## About the Frontend

 - The entire code was written form scratch by Nishchay without using any sort of template or external help (other than some JS snippets from w3schools). Charts were interactive and easy to use. This was done with the help of a library called chart.js
 - The UI/UX , color scheme, fonts, wire-framing, etc was thought about immensely, while writing the code in PHP, CSS, JS.
 - Micro-animations were also implemented to give the website a more fluidic feel.

 - There are a total of four tabs <ul>
    <li>Home : Gives a brief introduction about our research interests in our department.
    <li>Professors : All the professors in the form of cards, which when clicked, hover over to their respective boxes. These boxes contain info about their research areas, as well as their top 5 most cited papers.
    </li>
    <li>Insights : Shows some insights that the backend team (Nityam and Shantanu) was able to gather after studying the data. All the insights were represented in the form of interactive charts.
    <li>Publications : Shows information about all the papers that were published by professors of our department (solo as well as collaborations with other departments).
