Hand gestures are used in many human-computer interfaces for their natural and simplistic contactless way of conveying instruction to the interface. However, the recognition of hand gestures is complicated by numerous factors. This paper addresses a few issues by proposing a two-stage recognition framework that uses a hand joint localization technique. Firstly, the proposed method predicts hand keypoints that localize the region of interest by encompassing the hand region through a bounding box. Subsequently, this region of interest is used in gesture recognizing. The proposed work uses only one input modality-RGB image and performs phenomenally despite background clutter and illumination variation.', 'Scholar articles': 'Two-Stage Hand Gesture Recognition based on Hand Keypoints Localization\\nDR Neog, MK Bhuyan, M Das, RH Lashkar - … on Wireless Communications Signal Processing and …, 2022\\nRelated articles', 'Citation Count': {}}\n",

However, in many real world applications like medicine, where training data is very scarce or difficult to obtain; model acquisition becomes a challenge. For instance, we may have a classification task in one domain of interest whereas sufficient training data is available in a different domain of interest. The latter domain may have a different feature space or follow a different distribution from the one we are interested in. In such cases, carrying forward the structural properties of a model learned in a source domain where training data is ample and reusing it partially or fully in a target domain can save us expensive data-labeling efforts.

First, we measure the subtle movements of the soft tissues of the eye region using a monocular RGB-D camera setup, and second, we model and animate these movements using parameterized motion models. The muscles and skin of the eye region are very thin and sheetlike. By representing these tissues as thin elastic sheets in reduced coordinates, we have shown how we can measure and animate these tissues efficiently. To measure tissue movements, we optically track both eye and skin motions using monocular video sequences. The key idea here is to use a reduced coordinates framework to model thin sheet-like facial skin of the eye region. This framework implicitly constrains skin to conform to the shape of the underlying object when it slides. The skin configuration can then be efficiently reconstructed in 3D by tracking two dimensional skin features in video. This reduced coordinates model allows interactive real-time animation of the eye region in WebGL enabled devices using a small number of animation parameters, including gaze. Additionally, we have shown that the same reduced coordinates framework can also be used for physics-based simulation of the facial tissue movements and to produce tissue deformations that occur in facial expressions. We validated our skin measurement and animation algorithms using skin movement sequences with known skin motions, and we can recover skin sliding motions with low reconstruction errors.

Despite major advances in simulating elastodynamics of cloth and soft bodies for computer graphics, such methods are difficult to use for simulating thin skin due to the need to deal with non-conforming meshes, collision detection, and contact response. We propose a novel Eulerian representation of skin that avoids all the difficulties of constraining the skin to lie on the body surface by working directly on the surface itself.

Recently, Kundu and Nandi [Parameter estimation of chirp signals in presence of stationary noise. Stat Sin. 2008;75:187–201] studied the asymptotic properties of least squares estimators (LSEs) of the unknown parameters of a simple chirp signal model under the assumption of stationary noise. In this paper, we propose periodogram-type estimators called the approximate least squares estimators (ALSEs) to estimate the unknown parameters and study the asymptotic properties of these estimators under the same error assumptions.

This particular model has several applications in statistical signal processing and texture analysis. Extensive work has been done in developing several efficient procedures and establishing their properties. The least squares estimators (LSEs) are known to be the most efficient estimators in presence of additive noise. But it is observed that the accuracy of the LSEs is easily affected by even small perturbations in the data. In this manuscript, we propose to use the weighted least squares estimators (WLSEs) of the parameters that are unknown in presence of additive white noise. It is observed that the WLSEs are more robust towards outliers than the LSEs. Moreover, the WLSEs behave in the same manner as one of the most well-known robust estimators, the least absolute deviation estimators (LADEs). It is observed that developing the properties of the LADEs is not straightforward. Here, we derive the asymptotic properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed WLSEs. Extensive simulations have been performed to show the effectiveness of this method. One synthetic data set has been analyzed to illustrate how the proposed method can be used in practice.', 'Scholar articles': 'Robust Estimators of Two-Dimensional Sinusoidal Model Parameters\\nD Kundu, R Grover - Available at SSRN 4290828\\nRelated articles', 'Citation Count': {}}\n",

In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining regret guarantees for MAB problems in which the rewards of each arm form a Markov chain which may not belong to a single parameter exponential family. To achieve logarithmic regret in such problems is not difficult: a variation of standard Kullback-Leibler Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) does the job. However, the constants obtained from such an analysis are poor for the following reason: i.i.d. rewards are a special case of Markov rewards and it is difficult to design an algorithm that works well independent of whether the underlying model is truly Markovian or i.i.d. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm that identifies whether the rewards from each arm are truly Markovian or i.i.d. using a total variation distance-based test. Our algorithm then switches from using a standard KL-UCB to a specialized version of KL-UCB when it determines that the arm reward is Markovian, thus resulting in low regret for both i.i.d. and Markovian settings.', 'Scholar articles': 'Adaptive KL-UCB based Bandit Algorithms for Markovian and iid Settings\\nA Roy, S Shakkottai, R Srikant - arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.06606, 2020\\nRelated articles All 2 versions', 'Citation Count': {}}\n",

Hence, achieving efficient architectures along with enhanced accuracy is of paramount importance. Since, accuracy and model size of CNNs are intrinsically contentious in nature, the challenge is to achieve a decent trade-off between accuracy and model size. To address this, we propose a novel Factorized Pyramidal Learning (FPL) module to aggregate rich contextual information in an efficient manner.

This strategy of maintaining a global view of the network optimizes resource management. However, the implementation of SDN using a single physical controller lead to issues of scalability and robustness. A physically distributed but logically centralized SDN controller architecture promises to resolve both these issues. Distributed SDN along with its benefits brings along the problem of the number of controllers required and their placement in the network. This problem is referred to as the controller placement problem (CPP) and this paper is mainly concerned with the CPP solution techniques. The paper formally defines CPP, gives a comprehensive review of the various performance metrics and characteristics of the available CPP solutions.

Another approach to handle mobility induced route failure is multipath reactive protocols. These protocols start forwarding the packet on the first available route and switches path when a route failure is detected. Although these multipath protocols save on route rediscovery overhead, we establish that they still incur a substantial overhead called route handover cost, while switching among the alternate paths.

Existing works for ET require knowledge about the domain and target label set for a given test instance. ET in the absence of such knowledge is a novel problem that we address as ET in the wild. We hypothesize that the solution to this problem is to build supervised models that generalize better on the ET task as a whole, rather than a specific dataset. In this direction, we propose a Collective Learning Framework (CLF), which enables learning from diverse datasets in a unified way. The CLF first creates a unified hierarchical label set (UHLS) and a label mapping by aggregating label information from all available datasets. Then it builds a single neural network classifier using UHLS, label mapping and a partial loss function. The single classifier predicts the finest possible label across all available domains even though these labels may not be present in any domain-specific dataset. We also propose a set of evaluation schemes and metrics to evaluate the performance of models in this novel problem.

This work explores various existing visualization techniques in their ability to infer relevant sequence information learned by a recurrent neural network (RNN) on the task of splice junction identification. The visualization techniques have been modulated to suit the genome sequences as input. The visualizations inspect genomic regions at the level of a single nucleotide as well as a span of consecutive nucleotides. This inspection is performed based on modification of input sequences (perturbation-based) or the embedding space (back-propagation based). We infer features pertaining to both canonical and non-canonical splicing from a single neural model.

We hypothesize that the solution to this problem is to build supervised models that generalize better on the ET task as a whole, rather than a specific dataset. In this direction, we propose a Collective Learning Framework (CLF), which enables learning from diverse datasets in a unified way. The CLF first creates a unified hierarchical label set (UHLS) and a label mapping by aggregating label information from all available datasets. Then it builds a single neural network classifier using UHLS, label mapping, and a partial loss function. The single classifier predicts the finest possible label across all available domains even though these labels may not be present in any domain-specific dataset. We also propose a set of evaluation schemes and metrics to evaluate the performance of models in this novel problem.

Starting with Waddington’s epigenetic landscape, phenotypic state transition is seen as a movement of cells on a potential landscape. Though the landscape model is close to the thermodynamic principles of state change, it is difficult to envisage it from experimental observations. Therefore, phenotypic state transition is often considered as a discrete state jump process.

Here, we investigated phenotypic state transition dynamics of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)-induced EMT in a breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468.

The spindle and circular states are the migratory phenotypes. Using quantitative image analysis and mathematical modeling, we have deciphered state transition trajectories in different experimental conditions. This analysis shows that the phenotypic state transition during EGF-induced EMT in these cells is reversible, and depends upon the dose of EGF and level of phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR). The dominant reversible state transition trajectory in this system was cobble to circular to spindle to cobble. We have observed that there exists an ultrasensitive on/off switch involving phospho-EGFR that decides the transition of cells in and out of the circular state. In general, our observations can be explained by the conventional quasi-potential landscape model for phenotypic state transition.

We have created a mathematical model for this circuit. Analysis of this model shows that the negative feedback acts as a filter and preferentially allows a signal, with sharp and faster rise of phospho-Akt, to induce pronounced activation of S6K1. It blocks an input with a fast oscillation of phospho-Akt to flow through this path.

Stochasticity in gene expression gives rise to heterogeneity in expression in genetically identical cells. Positive feedback increases such heterogeneity and often gives rise to two subpopulations of cells, having higher and lower expression of a gene. Using flow cytometry, we show that U-87 MG cells have a minuscule subpopulation with detectable expression of CR-1. Induction of CR-1 expression, by exogenous CR-1, increases the size of this CR-1 positive subpopulation. However, even at very high dose, most of the cells remain CR-1 negative. We show that population behavior of CR-1 induction has a signature similar to bimodal expression expected in a transcriptional circuit with positive feedback. We further show that treatment of U-87 MG cells with CR-1 leads to higher expression of drug efflux protein MDR-1 in the CR-1 positive subpopulation, indicating correlated induction of these two proteins.

The customized household load data specific to a location is not available easily. Therefore, a simulated data-set of the household load pattern can also be helpful. In this paper, we have used a strategy to forecast short term load for households by pooling together load profiles from 20 households and achieved considerable improvement upon the primary results by analyzing one model parameter: the time-lag provided in the look-back window.

This thesis focuses on developing novel methods for basic unit modeling in online handwriting recognition. Three different directions of work are presented in this thesis for basic unit modeling. In the first part, two novel strategies are proposed to improve the classification ability of an existing basic unit recognition system by performing a reevaluation of the decision of a classifier.

The second part of the thesis presents two new feature representations for the basic units, mainly from a probabilistic viewpoint. In the first representation, the probabilistic features are derived from a set of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) which are learned on the existing feature space. On the other hand, the second feature representation is extracted directly from the trace of online handwriting by adopting a convolution neural network (CNN).

While it has been widely recognized to be one of the major disease burdens in populations, complexities in definitive diagnosis present a major challenge. Usually, trained psychologists utilize conventional methods including individualized interview assessment and manually administered PHQ-8 scoring. However, heterogeneity in symptomatic presentations, which span somatic to affective complaints, impart substantial subjectivity in its diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy is further compounded by the cross-sectional nature of sporadic assessment methods during physician-office visits, especially since depressive symptoms/severity may evolve over time. With widespread acceptance of smart wearable devices and smartphones, passive monitoring of depression traits using behavioral signals such as speech presents a unique opportunity as companion diagnostics to assist the trained clinicians in objective assessment over time. Therefore, we propose a framework for automated depression classification leveraging alterations in speech patterns in the well documented and extensively studied DAIC-WOZ depression dataset. This novel tensor-based approach requires a substantially simpler implementation architecture and extracts discriminative features for depression recognition with high f1 score and accuracy. We posit that such algorithms, which use significantly less compute load would allow effective onboard deployment in wearables for improve diagnostics accuracy and real-time monitoring of depressive disorders.', 'Scholar articles': 'A deep tensor-based approach for automatic depression recognition from speech utterances\\nSK Pandey, HS Shekhawat, SRM Prasanna, S Bhasin… - Plos one, 2022\\nRelated articles All 5 versions', 'Citation Count': {}}\n",

The present study applied 3D dynamic fracture healing scheme modelled on a subtrochanteric femur fracture, regulated by both finite element (FE) analysis and Fuzzy logic control in order to understand the spatio-temporal healing phenomena for both LP and DCP. The study further examined the influence of the two screw fixation mechanisms in determining the comparative progression of fracture healing. The problem was solved iteratively in several healing steps running in loop and accordingly, the local tissue concentrations and material properties were updated. The predicted results accorded well with various previous experimental observations. The study found an initial delay in healing associated with DCP.

One such notion is individual fairness (IF), which requires that individuals who are similar receive similar treatment. In parallel, matrix estimation (ME) has emerged as a natural paradigm for handling noisy data with missing values. In this work, we connect the two concepts. We show that pre-processing data using ME can improve an algorithm's IF without sacrificing performance. Specifically, we show that using a popular ME method known as singular value thresholding (SVT) to pre-process the data provides a strong IF guarantee under appropriate conditions. We then show that, under analogous conditions, SVT pre-processing also yields estimates that are consistent and approximately minimax optimal. As such, the ME pre-processing step does not, under the stated conditions, increase the prediction error of the base algorithm, i.e., does not impose a fairness-performance trade-off. We verify these results on synthetic and real data.\", 'Scholar articles': 'Matrix Estimation for Individual Fairness\\nCY Zhang, SH Cen, D Shah - arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.02096, 2023\\nAll 2 versions', 'Citation Count': {}}\n",

To answer this question, researchers traditionally need to run an experiment applying the drug of interest to that cell type. This approach is not scalable: given a large number of different actions (compounds) and a large number of different contexts (cell types), it is infeasible to run an experiment for every action-context pair. In such cases, one would ideally like to predict the outcome for every pair while only needing outcome data for a small _subset_ of pairs. This task, which we label\" causal imputation\", is a generalization of the causal transportability problem. To address this challenge, we extend the recently introduced _synthetic interventions_ (SI) estimator to handle more general data sparsity patterns.

Unfortunately, the uncertainty in the model control variable which includes model parameters, initial and boundary conditions, propagates through the model, resulting in the degradation of streamflow forecast. Various studies in the past have shown the potential of soil moisture assimilation in hydrological models resulting in the improved forecast. Further, the efficiency of assimilation is based on the number and the distribution of observations used. This study proposes a new approach called Forward sensitivity method (FSM), which operates in two phases. By running the model and forecast sensitivity dynamics forward in time, the first phase places the observations at or near where the square of the forecast sensitivity with respect to the control takes maximum values. Then using only this subset of observations, the second phase estimates the unknown elements of the control by solving a resulting weighted least squares problem. The power of this approach is demonstrated by assimilating ASCAT soil moisture observations into a conceptual Two Parameter Model in a medium sized watershed lying in the Krishna River Basin, India. The model run extends for four monsoon years from June 2007 to June 2011 and two assimilation scenarios were tested.

This problem is examined by using Saltzman’s spectral model of convection that admits both chaotic and nonchaotic regimes and is controlled by two parameters—Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. The problem is simplified by stripping the seven-variable constraint to a three-variable constraint. Since emphasis is placed on observation positioning to avoid cost-function flatness, forecast sensitivity to controls is needed. Four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) is silent on this issue of observation placement while Forecast Sensitivity Method (FSM) delivers sensitivities used in placement. With knowledge of the temporal forecast sensitivity matrix V, derivatives of the forecast variables to controls, the cost function can be expressed as a function of the observability Gramian VTV using first-order Taylor series expansion. The goal is to locate observations at places that force the Gramian positive definite. Further, locations are chosen such that the condition number of VTV is small and this guarantees convexity in the vicinity of the cost function minimum. Four numerical experiments are executed, and results are compared with the structure of the cost function independently determined though arduous computation over a wide range of the two nondimensional numbers.

The accurate estimation of the model parameters is vital to understand how the solution trajectory evolves in time. To this end, we provide a forward sensitivity method (FSM) approach to quantify the main model parameters using sparse measurement data. FSM constitutes a variational data assimilation technique which integrates model sensitivities into the process of fitting the model to the observations. We analyze the applicability of FSM to update the FHN model parameters and predict its dynamical characteristics.

The theme of the work is use of a low-order mixed-layer model that is faithful to the phenomenon in the context of dynamic data assimilation. Data assimilation experiments in the identical-twin mode determine the best place to make observations that minimize the forecast error through adjustment of model controls. The emphasized controls are those associated with the fluxes of heat and moisture from sea to atmosphere. Results indicate that the best observations are at that time and place when the outflowing continental air passes over the warmest sea surface temperatures. In the case studied, this warmest zone is directly over the Loop Current. Observations at times long after the modified air leaves these warmest waters lead to relatively poor control adjustments and little improvement in the forecast. If input to data assimilation is restricted to observations of a single model variable over short intervals of time (the order of several hours), results are relatively poor. Yet, a significant improvement is forthcoming if one of the observations is replaced by an observation from another model variable. This result is understood through arguments based on forecast sensitivity to model control.

One of the most important means of achieving this is to use spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets of critical aerosol properties, such as spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA), which are the most important parameters for estimating aerosol radiative effects. However, observations do not provide the above; the space-borne observations though provide wide spatial coverage, are temporal snapshots and suffer from possible sensor degradation over extended periods. On the other hand, the ground-based measurements provide more accurate and temporally continuous data but are spatially near-point observations. Realizing the need for spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets on one hand and the near non-existence of such data over the south Asian region (which is one of the regions where aerosols show large heterogeneity in most of their properties), construction of accurate gridded aerosol products by synthesizing the long-term space-borne and ground-based data has been taken up as an important objective of the South West Asian Aerosol Monsoon Interactions (SWAAMI), a joint Indo-UK field campaign, aiming at characterizing aerosol–monsoon links and their variabilities over the Indian region.\\nIn Part 1 of this two-part paper, we present spatially homogeneous gridded datasets of AOD and absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD), generated for the first time over this region.

       " 'Description': 'We present a novel approach for simulating thin hyperelastic skin. Real human skin is only a few millimeters thick. It can stretch and slide over underlying body structures such as muscles, bones, and tendons, revealing rich details of a moving character. Simulating such skin is challenging because it is in close contact with the body and shares its geometry. Despite major advances in simulating elastodynamics of cloth and soft bodies for computer graphics, such methods are difficult to use for simulating thin skin due to the need to deal with non-conforming meshes, collision detection, and contact response. We propose a novel Eulerian representation of skin that avoids all the difficulties of constraining the skin to lie on the body surface by working directly on the surface itself. Skin is modeled as a 2D hyperelastic membrane with arbitrary topology, which makes it easy to cover an entire character or object. Unlike most …',\n",
