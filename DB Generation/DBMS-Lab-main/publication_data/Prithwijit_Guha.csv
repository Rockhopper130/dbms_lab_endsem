VQA with Cascade of Self-and Co-Attention Blocks,"Aakansha Mishra, Ashish Anand, Prithwijit Guha",2023/2/28,arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.14777,,,,"The use of complex attention modules has improved the performance of the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. This work aims to learn an improved multi-modal representation through dense interaction of visual and textual modalities. The proposed model has an attention block containing both self-attention and co-attention on image and text. The self-attention modules provide the contextual information of objects (for an image) and words (for a question) that are crucial for inferring an answer. On the other hand, co-attention aids the interaction of image and text. Further, fine-grained information is obtained from two modalities by using a Cascade of Self- and Co-Attention blocks (CSCA). This proposal is benchmarked on the widely used VQA2.0 and TDIUC datasets. The efficacy of key components of the model and cascading of attention modules are demonstrated by experiments involving ablation analysis.",0,"VQA with Cascade of Self-and Co-Attention Blocks

Overlapped Speech Detection Using AM-FM Based Time-Frequency Representations,"Shikha Baghel, SRM Prasanna, Prithwijit Guha",2022/11/10,,,,Springer International Publishing,"Overlapped speech contains simultaneous speech of multiple speakers. The presence of overlapped speech is one of the main sources of error for speaker diarization, speech, and speaker recognition systems. Most of the existing works used magnitude spectrum based features for overlap detection. This work focuses on detecting overlapped speech by exploring instantaneous phase and amplitude information of speech signal. Phase characteristics are captured by the Instantaneous Frequency Spectrogram (IFSpec), while Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TEO) based pyknograms are used for representing instantaneous amplitude. Features are learned from the IF spectrogram and TEO-based pyknogram automatically using Fully-Convolutional Neural Network (F-CNN).

Speech Music Overlap Detection Using Spectral Peak Evolutions,"Mrinmoy Bhattacharjee, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Prithwijit Guha",2022/11/10,,,,Springer International Publishing,"Speech-music overlap detection in audio signals is an essential preprocessing step for many high-level audio processing applications. Speech and music spectrograms exhibit characteristic harmonic striations that can be used as a feature for detecting their overlap. Hence, this work proposes two features generated using a spectral peak tracking algorithm to capture prominent harmonic patterns in spectrograms. One feature consists of the spectral peak amplitude evolutions in an audio interval. The second feature is designed as a Mel-scaled spectrogram obtained by suppressing non-peak spectral components. In addition, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network architecture is proposed to learn the temporal evolution of spectral peaks. Mel-spectrogram is used as a baseline feature to compare performances. A popular public dataset MUSAN with 102 h of data has been used to perform experiments.

Only overlay text: novel features for TV news broadcast video segmentation,"Raghvendra Kannao, Prithwijit Guha, Bidyut B Chaudhuri",2022/9,Multimedia Tools and Applications,81.0,21.0,Springer US,"Segmentation of television news videos into programs and stories (after removing advertisements) is a necessary first step for news broadcast analysis. Existing methods have used manually defined presentation styles as an important feature for such segmentation. Manually defined presentation styles make algorithms channel specific and hampers scalability for large number of channels. In this work, we advocate the usebility of overlay text for automatic characterization of broadcast presentation styles. This automatic characterization will minimize the manual intervention required in developing the scalable solutions for television news broadcast segmentation.

Facial Keypoint Sequence Generation from Audio,"Prateek Manocha, Prithwijit Guha",2020/11/2,arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.01114,,,,"Whenever we speak, our voice is accompanied by facial movements and expressions. Several recent works have shown the synthesis of highly photo-realistic videos of talking faces, but they either require a source video to drive the target face or only generate videos with a fixed head pose. This lack of facial movement is because most of these works focus on the lip movement in sync with the audio while assuming the remaining facial keypoints' fixed nature. To address this, a unique audio-keypoint dataset of over 150,000 videos at 224p and 25fps is introduced that relates the facial keypoint movement for the given audio. This dataset is then further used to train the model, Audio2Keypoint, a novel approach for synthesizing facial keypoint movement to go with the audio. Given a single image of the target person and an audio sequence (in any language), Audio2Keypoint generates a plausible keypoint movement sequence in sync with the input audio, conditioned on the input image to preserve the target person's facial characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes an audio-keypoint dataset and learns a model to output the plausible keypoint sequence to go with audio of any arbitrary length. Audio2Keypoint generalizes across unseen people with a different facial structure allowing us to generate the sequence with the voice from any source or even synthetic voices. Instead of learning a direct mapping from audio to video domain, this work aims to learn the audio-keypoint mapping that allows for in-plane and out-of-plane head rotations, while preserving the person's identity using a Pose Invariant (PIV) Encoder.",0,"Facial Keypoint Sequence Generation from Audio

Classification of speech vs. Speech with background music,"Mrinmoy Bhattacharjee, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Prithwijit Guha",2020/7/19,,,,IEEE,Applications that perform enhancement of speech containing background music require a critical preprocessing step that can efficiently detect such segments. This work proposes such a preprocessing method to detect speech with background music that is mixed at different SNR levels. A bag-of-words approach is proposed in this work. Representative dictionaries from speech and music data are first learned. The signals are processed as spectrograms of 1s intervals. Rows of these spectrograms are used to learn separate speech and music dictionaries. This work proposes a weighting scheme to reduce confusion by suppressing codewords of one class that have similarities to the other class. The proposed feature is a weighted histogram of 1s audio intervals obtained from the learned dictionaries. The classification is performed using a deep neural network classifier. The proposed approach is validated against a …,1,"Classification of speech vs. Speech with background music

CQ-VQA: Visual Question Answering on Categorized Questions,"Aakansha Mishra, Ashish Anand, Prithwijit Guha",2020/7/19,,,,IEEE,"This paper proposes CQ-VQA, a novel two-level hierarchical but end-to-end model to solve the task of visual question answering (VQA). The first level of CQ-VQA, referred to as Question Categorizer (QC), classifies questions to reduce the potential answer search space. The QC uses attended and fused features of the input question and image. The second level, referred to as Answer Predictor (AP), comprises of a set of distinct classifiers corresponding to each question category. Depending on the question category predicted by QC, only one of the classifiers of AP remains active. The loss functions of QC and AP are aggregated together to make it an end-to-end model. The proposed model (CQ-VQA) is evaluated on the TDIUC dataset and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches. Results indicate a competitive or better performance of CQ-VQA.",2,"CQ-VQA: Visual Question Answering on Categorized Questions

Traditional features represent various properties of the audio signal but do not necessarily capture such patterns. This work proposes to model such spectrogram patterns using a novel Spectral Peak Tracking (SPT) approach. Two novel time-frequency features for speech vs. music classification are proposed. The proposed features are extracted in two stages. First, SPT is performed to track a preset number of highest amplitude spectral peaks in an audio interval. In the second stage, the location and amplitudes of these peak traces are used to compute the proposed feature sets. The first feature involves the computation of mean and standard deviation of peak traces. The second feature is obtained as averaged component posterior probability vectors of Gaussian mixture models learned on the peak traces.

A system for semantic segmentation of TV news broadcast videos,"Raghvendra Kannao, Prithwijit Guha",2020/3,Multimedia Tools and Applications,79.0,,Springer US,"TV news channels present rich and complete experience of various events through audio-visual content. This makes television news an influential medium to affect masses and thus persuaded various social scientists and regulators to monitor and analyze the content of broadcast videos. An organized archive of newscast is a prerequisite for any such analysis. Creating such archive requires segmentation of continuous news videos into suitable logical units. Based on the application, these logical units may be one of channel content obtained after advertisement removal, different shows, news stories or video shots. In this work, we propose an end to end system with software architecture for segmenting the TV broadcast videos at all these four granularities. The videos are segmented into shots.

Analysis of excitation source characteristics for shouted and normal speech classification,"Shikha Baghel, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Prithwijit Guha",2020/2/21,,,,IEEE,"The present work is aimed at analysing the excitation source characteristics of normal and shouted speech. In this context, we analyze the Differenced Electroglottogram (DEGG) signal corresponding to different vowels. This work proposes two novel excitation source features that are estimated from DEGG signal. These features are (a) Open Phase Triangle Area (OPTA) and (b) Flatness of Glottal Cycle (FoGC). OPTA captures the effect of open phase duration and slope of DEGG signal. FoGC measures the change in source characteristics due to strength of excitation (SoE) and pitch period. A practical issue in using the proposed features is the unavailability of DEGG signal in most speech processing applications. To overcome this problem, the integrated linear prediction residual (ILPR) signal estimated from speech is considered as an approximation of DEGG. We show that the proposed features can be computed …",2,"Analysis of excitation source characteristics for shouted and normal speech classification

This motivates several stakeholders to monitor and analyze the news broadcasts. Segmentation of streaming broadcast into programs and stories is a necessary first step for such analysis. Television news producers use predefined and unique presentation styles to create the channel content. Presentation styles vary with program and news story category, broadcast time, targeted audience etc. This motivated us to use presentation styles as features for segmenting news broadcasts. We propose a novel approach for characterization of spatio-temporal presentation styles. This involves characterization of spatial styles using a set of (presentation style specific) semantic shot categories derived from LSCOM-Lite Ontology.

Visual Object Tracking Using Perceptron Forests and Optical Flow,"Gaurav Nakum, Prithwijit Guha, Rashmi Dutta Baruah",2019,,,,Springer International Publishing,"This work proposes a new approach for target representation and candidate proposal selection to track single objects in videos. Constructing an appearance model that is robust to visual appearance changes is a challenging problem in visual tracking. Typically, complicated models are used to achieve this robustness. However, such models have high computational cost and thus, are not suitable for real-time tracking. In this paper, we propose a visual tracking algorithm in which target objects are represented by compact low-dimensional codes, constructed using perceptron forests. We employ the highly successful tracking-by-detection framework to use these representations for training an online discriminative classifier to separate the object from the background. Moreover, the candidate proposals are generated from a two-phase strategy.

Mostly hand-crafted features have been explored for shouted speech detection. However, many works on audio processing suggest that approaches based on automatic feature learning are more robust than hand-crafted feature engineering. This work re-demonstrates this notion by proposing a 1D-CNN architecture for shouted and normal speech classification task. The CNN learns features from the magnitude spectrum of speech frames. Classification is performed by fully connected layers at later stages of the network. Performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated on three datasets and validated against three existing approaches. As an additional contribution, a discussion of features learned by the CNN kernels is provided with relevant visualizations.",4,"Shouted and normal speech classification using 1D CNN

First, a preset number of prominent spectral peak locations are identified from the spectra of each frame. These important peak locations obtained from each frame are used to form Spectral peak sequences (SPS) for an audio interval. In second stage, these SPS are treated as time series data of frequency locations. The proposed features are extracted as periodicity, average frequency and statistical attributes of these spectral peak sequences. Speech-music categorization is performed by learning binary classifiers on these features. We have experimented with Gaussian mixture models, support vector machine and random forest classifiers.

This is achieved by optimizing image feature similarity based objective functions in object state space. Meta-heuristic algorithms have shown promising results in solving hard optimization problems where gradients are not available. This motivated us to use Firefly algorithms in visual object tracking. The object state is represented by its bounding box parameters and the target is modeled by its color distribution. This work has two significant contributions. First, we propose a hybrid firefly algorithm where genetic operations are performed using Real-coded Genetic Algorithm(RGA). Here, the crossover operation is modified by incorporating parent velocity information. Second, the firefly brightness is computed from both foreground and background information (as opposed to only foreground).

Existing works in this area have mostly focused on C4.S trees that learn axis aligned partitions. On the other hand, neural trees learn oblique partitions from data and use lesser number of decision nodes hosting perceptrons. However, these perceptrons are susceptible to data imbalances. This motivated us to propose a progressively balanced neural tree where training dataset are balanced prior to perceptron learning. The second contribution is the optimization of the decision function with respect to entropy impurity based objective functions. This formulation also allows a parent node to have more than two child nodes.
