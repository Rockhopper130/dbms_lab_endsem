Does preclinical analysis based on static loading underestimate post-surgery stem micromotion in THA as opposed to dynamic gait loading?,"Adeline S Vio War, Neeraj Kumar, Souptick Chanda",2023/2/10,Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"The success of cementless hip stems depends on the primary stability of the implant quantified by the amount of micromotion at the bone-stem interface. Most finite element (FE)–based preclinical studies on post-surgery stem stability rely on static analysis. Hence, the effect of dynamic gait loading on bone-stem relative micromotion remains virtually unexplored. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research on the primary stability of grooved stems as opposed to plain stem design. The primary aim of this FE study was to understand whether transient dynamic gait had any incremental effect on the net micromotion results and to further draw insights into the effects of grooved texture vis-à-vis a plain model on micromotion and proximal load transfer in host bone.

A preclinical model of post-surgery secondary bone healing for subtrochanteric femoral fracture based on fuzzy interpretations,"Pratik Nag, Souptick Chanda",2022/7/21,Plos one,17.0,7,Public Library of Science,"Mechanobiology plays an essential role in secondary bone fracture healing. While the introduction of newer type of plates, e.g. locking plate (LP), is becoming increasingly popular for complex femoral fractures, the conventional technique involving dynamic compression plate (DCP) remains the standard choice. The difference between the two techniques lies primarily in their screw fixation mechanisms. The present study applied 3D dynamic fracture healing scheme modelled on a subtrochanteric femur fracture, regulated by both finite element (FE) analysis and Fuzzy logic control in order to understand the spatio-temporal healing phenomena for both LP and DCP. The study further examined the influence of the two screw fixation mechanisms in determining the comparative progression of fracture healing. The problem was solved iteratively in several healing steps running in loop and accordingly, the local tissue concentrations and material properties were updated. The predicted results accorded well with various previous experimental observations. The study found an initial delay in healing associated with DCP. However, as the healing progressed, there was no significant difference in overall callus modulus. The presented preclinical model may further help predict bone healing for different implantation techniques, and thus can serve as a non-invasive tool for evaluating relative merits of extramedullary plating techniques.",0,"A preclinical model of post-surgery secondary bone healing for subtrochanteric femoral fracture based on fuzzy interpretations

MECHANOBIOLOGY-BASED MICROSCALE STUDY OF INFLUENCE OF SURFACE TEXTURE DESIGN ON PERIACETABULAR BONE INGROWTH,"R Ghosh, S Chanda, D Chakraborty",2019/4,Orthopaedic Proceedings,101.0,SUPP_5,The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery,"Introduction
Uncemented porous coated acetabular components have gained more research emphasis in recent years compared to their cemented counterparts, largely owing to the natural biological fixation they offer. Nevertheless, sufficient peri-prosthetic bone ingrowth is essential for long-term fixation of such uncemented acetabular components. The phenomenon of bone ingrowth can be predicted based on mechanoregulatory principles of primary bone fracture healing. Literature review reveals that the surface texture of implant plays a major role in implant-bone fixation mechanism. A few insilico models based on 2-D microscale finite elements (FE) were reported in literatures to predict the influence of surface texture designs on peri-prosthetic bone ingrowth. However, most of these studies were based on FE models of dental implants.

The Young's moduli of cancellous bone was considered 5.3 GPa for the first instance and 7.8 GPa in the second instance and that of Titanium-alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) implant was 113 GPa and Cobalt-alloy (Co-Cr) implant was 210 GPa. The modulus of granulation tissue was considered 1 MPa initially. The Poisson's ratio for bone and implant was set to 0.3, whereas the granulation tissue Poisson's ratio was set to 0.167. All of the model's interfaces were considered perfectly bound. MSCs were thought to be abundant towards the bone surface.

Proximal Femoral Locking Plate: The Effect of Interface Conditions on Implant-induced Stress Shielding,"Pratik Nag, Souptick Chanda",,Stainless steel,193.0,,,"Proximal femoral locking plate (PFLP) is an extramedullary implant used in fixation of subtrochanteric and intertrochanteric femoral fracture. However, the fact whether PFLP is better than other fixation methods remains debatable. One important biomechanical parameter that affects adverse bone adaptation is the implant induced stress shielding of bone. The primary aim of this study was to understand the load transfer mechanism in a subtrochanteric femur fracture fixated with PFLP implant under physiological loading (F= 3kN). The 3D finite element (FE) models of the implanted and the intact femur were generated using the manufacturer supplied CAD model of a left femur. After analysis, it was found that the percentage stress shielding in the calcar cortical region of the bonded and the contact model was 24.5% and 49.18%, respectively. The maximum displacement for the intact model was~ 0.74 mm and the same for the bonded and contact model were found to be~ 0.685 mm and~ 0.687 mm, respectively. The maximum stress in the plate was predicted to be 54.56 kPa for the bonded model and that for the contact model was 42.78 kPa. In screws, the maximum stress values for the bonded and the contact models were 138.33 kPa and 107.96 kPa, respectively. It was also observed that the maximum stresses in both the cortical and the cancellous bone of the intact model were lesser compared to that of the respective bones in bonded and contact models.",0,"Proximal Femoral Locking Plate: The Effect of Interface Conditions on Implant-induced Stress Shielding

However, the tensile stresses generated in the cement mantle were low, around 3 MPa. he elevated bone strains occurring at the proximal femoral neck-cup junction region were progressively reduced with bone remodelling. Bone density distribution inside the femoral head was found to be similar to those for the metallic short-stem design. Although bone resorption, 50− 90% reduction in bone density was predominantly observed at the supero-proximal femoral head, bone apposition, 10–30% increase in bone density occurred in the other regions of the femoral head. Apart from better wear resistivity and chemically inert nature of ceramics, it appears from this study that alumina ceramic is a viable alternative to the metallic design.",0,"A Numerical Study on the Possibilities of Cemented Short-Stem Ceramic Femoral Resurfacing Implant
