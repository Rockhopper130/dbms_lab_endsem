Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a crucial performance metric of MRI, improvement of which can be exchanged for increased image resolution or decreased scan time. Besides the progress in various hardware and software techniques for improving SNR in MRI scanners, use of metasurfaces as accessories has recently shown potential towards enhancing SNR by boosting local magnetic field in the scanned volume. Magnetic field enhancement over a larger depth from the skin is essential for imaging of deeper tissues, which can be facilitated by a specifically designed metasurface. Here we present such a metasurface with complementary-type resonant structures on the two sides of a high-permittivity dielectric, which substantially increases magnetic flux density on the skin (forty-five fold) that decays down to …",0,"Aperture–patch sandwich metasurface for magnetic field enhancement in 1.5 T MRI

Higher SNR results in better image resolution or shorter scanning time during MRI scans. One of the techniques for increasing the SNR is by using RF metasurfaces as ‘add-ons’, which could fit in the available free space (< 2 cm) in an MRI receive array. In this work, a7 mm thick metasurface, capable of providing a tenfold boost in the SNR of 1. 5 T MRI, has been proposed. The proposed metasurface constitutes of a dielectric pad sandwiched between two metallic layers. Each metallic layer comprises fourteen thin resonating wire strips, which localize and redistribute the RF magnetic field in the near-field region.

The Larmor frequency of precession of the hydrogen atoms is determined by the strength of static magnetic field (B0) of MRI. A higher B0 can directly improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MRI. However, this method involves expensive hardware installation, which could have adverse effects of tissue-heating and make MRI unsafe for patients with medical implants. Hence, efforts have been made to increase the SNR of MRI without increasing B0.

Cooperative spectrum sensing using quantized energy statistics in the absence of dedicated reporting channel,"Kukil Khanikar, Rohit Sinha, Ratnajit Bhattacharjee",2018/1/8,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,67.0,5.0,IEEE,"Reporting channels are essential for implementing cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) in cognitive radio technology. In this paper, a novel decentralized CSS scheme capable of operating in the absence of dedicated reporting channels is presented. Existing schemes which operate in the absence of dedicated reporting channels rely on the transmission of hard decision bits from cooperating secondary users (CSUs). The proposed scheme supports a mobile spectrum sensor termed as the leading secondary sensor node (LSSN) to assist a contending secondary transmitter in spectrum sensing. Unlike existing schemes, the proposed CSS framework offers the freedom of using multiple bits for transmitting a quantized version of the test statistics between secondary user (SU) nodes. In order to reduce energy consumption and system complexity, the CSUs do not take part in sensing but only act as relays for …",8,"Cooperative spectrum sensing using quantized energy statistics in the absence of dedicated reporting channel

Several experimental and simulation studies have been performed to study the characteristics of the photoconductive antenna (PCA). Although various methods have been proposed to increase the radiated power from it, the radiated power remains very low. In this paper, we present an analytical study of improving the radiated power from a large aperture PCA using an external magnetic field source. The transit time behavior of the carriers is computed using the basic semiconductor carrier dynamics model, including the transient mobilities with the dependencies on the electric field and carrier's concentration. Analytical studies show that substantial enhancement in the radiated field can be achieved when such external magnetic field is applied.

Wideband Matched Feed Design Employing Conjugate Field Radiated from a Square Choke Excited by Two Slots on a Diagonal Waveguide,"Rajib Jana, Ratnajit Bhattacharjee",2018,Progress In Electromagnetics Research M,63.0,,EMW Publishing,"A simple and compact diagonal matched feed structure is proposed for offset reflector antenna, which includes a square choke to radiate the desired conjugate mode (TE 4: a higher order rectangular coaxial cable mode) for suppressing the cross-polar power of an offset reflector antenna when the reflector is illuminated by the dominant diagonal mode (TE V D: a linear combination of rectangular TE 01 and TE 10 modes) radiated from the aperture of a central diagonal waveguide. Square choke is excited by two identical slots on the central diagonal waveguide using the longitudinal magnetic field of main operating mode TE V D. Wideband conjugate matching as well as impedance matching for broadband operation can be achieved by such radiating main mode and conjugate mode from apertures which are spatially separated. Based on the above configuration, a J-band matched feed structure is designed using HFSS software for a given offset reflector geometry. The proposed matched feed structure is fabricated and measured. The measured results are compared with simulated ones, and close agreements are found.",0,"Wideband Matched Feed Design Employing Conjugate Field Radiated from a Square Choke Excited by Two Slots on a Diagonal Waveguide

A pillbox type RF window is designed using WR112 as input and output section of the pillbox. The simulated VSWR, return loss, and insertion loss of alumina 96% are obtained as 1.01, 46 dB, and 0.1 dB, respectively. The results obtained from CST and HFSS are compared and are found in good agreement. The window is designed using three different dielectric materials ie alumina 96%, alumina 99.5%, and sapphire. Thermal analysis of the window is carried out for 2 kW average input power. It is observed that sapphire has better thermal and EM performance than 96% and 99.5% alumina. The effect of the different loss tangents ie 0.01, 0.001, 0.0004 on the return loss and temperature profile is studied. The RF window is also studied for 4 kW and 8 kW average input powers.

The performance of the modulation recognition scheme has been evaluated by simulating different types of PSK signals. By putting appropriate Mean Square Error Difference Threshold (MSEDT) on Mean Square Error (MSE), the proposed scheme has been found to recognize the different modulated signals with 100% recognition accuracy at Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) as low as 1 dB in AWGN channels. The data samples required to be used for performing recognition is very small, thereby greatly reducing the time complexity of the recognizer. For fading signal Constant Modulus (CM) equalization has been applied prior to performing recognition. It has been observed that when CM equalization is used, 100% recognition can be achieved at SNR as low as 6 dB.",0,"AN AUTOMATIC BLIND MODULATION RECOGNITION ALGORITHM FOR M-PSK SIGNALS BASED ON MSE CRITERION

Optimal Design of a Coaxial Cavity Based on Quality-Factor Maximization for High-Power Coaxial Magnetron in  -Band,"Kaushik Debbarma, Ratnajit Bhattacharjee",,,,,,"This paper presents a comparative performance analysis of offset reflector fed by circular and square array of circular microstrip antennas. The performance analysis is done for an offset reflector targeted for VSAT application operating at 20 GHz. The offset reflector has a projected diameter, D= 0.75 m and clearance height, H= 0.075 m with an F/D ratio of 0.8, where F is the focal length of the main paraboloid. A parametric study has been done to obtain the optimum separation between the array elements in both array configurations. Cross-polar performance of the secondary field pattern of the offset reflector is considered for this parametric study. Both array configurations with optimum separation between antenna elements provide cross-polarization better than-30 dB at 20 GHz. The-30 dB cross-polar bandwidth for the square and circular array configuration is around 2.5 GHz and 3.1 GHz, respectively. Feasibility of a duplex link is explored by investigating the performance of the same reflector fed by SCA of circular microstrip antennas operating at 30 GHz.

Utilizing the space-time cross correlation parameters obtained from a one ring model, a correlated Nakagami-m 2× 2 channel is realized. Performance of STBC is obtained for such a correlated channel by varying several physical parameters of interest such as antenna separation at base and mobile stations, scatterer distribution around mobile station, angle of departure at base station.
