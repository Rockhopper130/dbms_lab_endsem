Risk measures and portfolio analysis in the paradigm of climate finance: a review,"Siddhartha P Chakrabarty, Suryadeepto Nag",2023/2/13,,3.0,3.0,Springer International Publishing,"Climate change brings with it new risks for the finance sector, which in turn provides new opportunities to mitigate this risk, emanating from climate change. To invest sustainably and move away from firms that have disproportionately high carbon footprints, investors need suitable risk measures and appropriate portfolio management approaches. In this paper, we conduct a review of the mathematical models used to measure carbon risk. Subsequently, we review portfolio optimization models based on modern portfolio theory and the incorporation of risk measures into portfolio optimization strategies. We find that there is a lack of consensus about the existence of a carbon premium or an equity greenium in stock prices. We also find that the literature on portfolio optimization techniques is comparatively nascent.",0,"Risk measures and portfolio analysis in the paradigm of climate finance: a review

A review of efficient Multilevel Monte Carlo algorithms for derivative pricing and risk management,"Devang Sinha, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty",2023/2/11,,,,Elsevier,"In this article, we present a review of the recent developments on the topic of Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) algorithms, in the paradigm of applications in financial engineering. We specifically focus on the recent studies conducted in two subareas, namely, option pricing and financial risk management. For the former, the discussion involves incorporation of the importance sampling algorithm, in conjunction with the MLMC estimator, thereby constructing a hybrid algorithms in order to achieve reduction for the overall variance of the estimator. In case of the latter, we discuss the studies carried out in order to construct an efficient algorithm in order to estimate the risk measures of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Var (CVaR). In this regard, we briefly discuss the motivation and the construction of an adaptive sampling algorithm with an aim to efficiently estimate the nested expectation, which, in general is …",0,"A review of efficient Multilevel Monte Carlo algorithms for derivative pricing and risk management

Single event transition risk: A measure for long term carbon exposure,"Suryadeepto Nag, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty, Sankarshan Basu",2023/1/5,MethodsX,,,Elsevier,"Although there is a growing consensus that a low-carbon transition will be necessary to mitigate accelerated climate change, the magnitude of transition risk for investors is difficult to measure exactly. Investors are therefore constrained by the unavailability of suitable measures to quantify the magnitude of the risk and are forced to use the likes of absolute emissions data or ESG scores in order to manage their portfolios. In this article, we define the Single Event Transition Risk (SETR) and illustrate how it can be used to approximate the magnitude of the total exposure of the price of a share to the low-carbon transition. We also discuss potential applications of the single event framework and the SETR as a risk measure and discuss future direction on how this can be extended to a system with multiple transition events.• The Single Event Transition Framework is formalized and the Single Event Transition Risk is …",1,"Single event transition risk: A measure for long term carbon exposure

Does limited liability reduce leveraged risk?: The case of loan portfolio management,"Deb Narayan Barik, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty",2022/11/7,Journal of Risk and Financial Management,15.0,11.0,MDPI,"Return–risk models are the two pillars of modern portfolio theory, which are widely used to make decisions in choosing the loan portfolio of a bank. Banks and other financial institutions are subjected to limited-liability protection. However, in most of the model formulation, limited liability is not taken into consideration. Accordingly, to address this, we have, in this article, analyzed the effect of including it in the model formulation. We formulate four models, two of which are maximizing the expected return with risk constraint, including and excluding limited liability, and other two of which are minimizing of risk with threshold level of return with and without limited liability. Our theoretical results show that the solutions of the models with limited liability produce better results than the others, in both minimizing risk and maximizing expected return. More specifically, the portfolios that included limited liability are less risky as compared to the portfolios that did not include limited liability. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to support the theoretical results obtained.",0,"Does limited liability reduce leveraged risk?: The case of loan portfolio management

The modification allows for administrators to quantify the extent to which voluntary social distancing norms are followed, and address restrictions accordingly. Modifications are also made to incorporate inter-region migration, and suitable metrics are proposed to quantify the impact of migration on the rise of cases.

We rely on the Robbins-Monro algorithm with projection, in order to approximate optimal change of measure parameter, for various levels of resolution in our multilevel algorithm. Furthermore, we propose incorporating discretization schemes with higher-order strong convergence, in order to simulate the underlying stochastic differential equations (SDEs) thereby achieving better accuracy. In order to do so, we study the Central Limit Theorem for the general multilevel algorithm. Further, we study the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, thereby proving the Strong Law of Large Numbers.

Two strains and drug adherence: An HIV model in the paradigm of community transmission,"Ashish Poonia, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty",2022/5,Nonlinear Dynamics,108.0,3.0,Springer Netherlands,"A two-strain model, comprising of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, is proposed for the dynamics of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) spread in a community. A treatment model is introduced by taking drug adherence into account. The treatment-free model is analyzed for the effect of treatment availability and drug adherence on disease dynamics. The analysis revealed that for the treatment-free model, at least one strain faces competitive exclusion, and co-existence of both strains is not possible. On the contrary, both strains may co-exist in presence of treatment. The analysis carried out was both local, as well as global. A comprehensive bifurcation analysis showed periodic behaviour and all solutions approached a stable limit cycle for a wide range of parametric values.

Studying the age of onset and detection of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia using a three-stage stochastic model,"Suryadeepto Nag, Ananda Shikhara Bhat, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty",2022,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,"Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a biphasic malignant clonal disorder that progresses, first with a chronic phase, where the cells have enhanced proliferation only, and then to a blast phase, where the cells have the ability of self-renewal. It is well-recognized that the Philadelphia chromosome (which contains the BCR-ABL fusion gene) is the ''hallmark of CML''. However, empirical studies have shown that the mere presence of BCR-ABL may not be a sufficient condition for the development of CML, and further modifications related to tumor suppressors may be necessary. Accordingly, we develop a three-mutation stochastic model of CML progression, with the three stages corresponding to the non-malignant cells with BCR-ABL presence, the malignant cells in the chronic phase and the malignant cells in the blast phase. We demonstrate that the model predictions agree with age incidence data from the United States.

Did the lockdown curb the spread of COVID-19 infection rate in India: A data-driven analysis,"Dipankar Mondal, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty",2020/6/22,arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.12006,,,,"In order to analyze the effectiveness of three successive nationwide lockdown enforced in India, we present a data-driven analysis of four key parameters, reducing the transmission rate, restraining the growth rate, flattening the epidemic curve and improving the health care system. These were quantified by the consideration of four different metrics, namely, reproduction rate, growth rate, doubling time and death to recovery ratio. The incidence data of the COVID-19 (during the period of 2nd March 2020 to 31st May 2020) outbreak in India was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve, making use of the exponential growth, the maximum likelihood estimation, sequential Bayesian method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction. The best fit (based on the data considered) was for the time-dependent approach. Accordingly, this approach was used to assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate. The period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3, saw a reduction in the rate of effective reproduction rate. During the same period the growth rate reduced from during the pre-lockdown to after lockdown 3, accompanied by the average doubling time increasing form - days to - days. Finally, the death-to-recovery ratio dropped from (pre-lockdown) to after lockdown 3. In conclusion, all the four metrics considered to assess the effectiveness of the lockdown, exhibited significant favourable changes, from the pre-lockdown period to the end of lockdown 3. Analysis of the data in the post-lockdown period with these metrics will provide greater clarity with regards to the extent of the success of the lockdown.",1,"Did the lockdown curb the spread of COVID-19 infection rate in India: A data-driven analysis

Does Marginal VaR Lead to Improved Performance of Managed Portfolios: A Study of S&P BSE 100 and S&P BSE 200,"Shrey Jain, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty",2020/6,Asia-Pacific Financial Markets,27.0,,Springer Japan,"In order to improve upon the performance of a managed portfolio, we propose the use of Marginal Value-at-Risk (MVaR) to ascertain the desirability of assets for inclusion in the managed portfolio, prior to obtaining the optimal managed portfolio. In particular, this is applied on a larger index which comprises of a greater number of assets than a benchmark index and the larger index includes all the assets from the benchmark index. The resulting MVaR index includes exactly the same number of assets as the benchmark index. An empirical study with S&P BSE 100 as the benchmark index, with the MVaR index being derived from S&P BSE 200, with five different optimization problems shows outperformance by the MVaR portfolio over the benchmark portfolio. This highlights the advantage of the inclusion of MVaR resulting in improved performance of the managed portfolio.",2,"Does Marginal VaR Lead to Improved Performance of Managed Portfolios: A Study of S&P BSE 100 and S&P BSE 200

A quantitative study on the role of TKI combined with Wnt/β-catenin signaling and IFN-α in the treatment of CML through deterministic and stochastic approaches,"Sonjoy Pan, Soumyendu Raha, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty",2020/4/1,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals",133.0,,Pergamon,"We propose deterministic and stochastic models for studying the pharmacokinetics of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in the presence of CTL immune response, upon administration of IFN-α (the traditional treatment for CML), TKI (the current frontline medication for CML) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling (the state-of-the art therapeutic breakthrough for CML). To the best of our knowledge, no mathematical model incorporating all these three therapeutic protocols are available in literature. The stability analysis of the system equilibria is undertaken in terms of a threshold parameter. Further, this work introduces a stochastic approach in the study of CML dynamics. The evolution of the dynamics for both the deterministic and the stochastic models are examined. This study addresses the question of how the dual therapy of TKI and Wnt/β-catenin signaling or triple combination of all three, offers potentially improved …",1,"A quantitative study on the role of TKI combined with Wnt/β-catenin signaling and IFN-α in the treatment of CML through deterministic and stochastic approaches

Stochastic analysis of in-host HCV dynamics through budding and bursting process,"Sonjoy Pan, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty",2020/1/1,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,80.0,,Elsevier,"Stochastic models for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection based on the dynamics of a deterministic model incorporating both modes of infection transmission (virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell) and antibody response with the consideration of natural cure of infected hepatocytes are developed and analyzed. In the model formulation, the two processes for the release of virions, namely, budding and bursting are assumed. The Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE) models for both budding and bursting processes with fixed as well as variable burst size are constructed using the property of linear transformation for multivariate normal distribution and the continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models utilizing the theory of multitype continuous-time branching process in its derivation. The stochastic means with standard deviations for the SDE model variables are numerically calculated and graphically compared with the results …",6,"Stochastic analysis of in-host HCV dynamics through budding and bursting process

Valuation of American passport option using a three-time level scheme,"Ankur Kanaujiya, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty",2019/6,Computational and Applied Mathematics,38.0,,Springer International Publishing,"An American passport option whose contingent claim is dependent on the balance of a trading account can be valued by solving a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation with free boundary. Here, we present the pricing problem for American passport option, as a sequence of linear complementarity problems, using the three-time level finite difference scheme, which typically is suitable for non-smooth payoffs and also applicable in case of large temporal grid size. The option price is obtained through this scheme for the non-symmetric case (when the risk-free rate is different from the cost of carry). It is observed that the numerical approach presented, results in solving the pricing problem using lesser number of grid points as compared to numerical approaches for this problem used previously while maintaining the accuracy of the prices obtained.",1,"Valuation of American passport option using a three-time level scheme

Threshold dynamics of HCV model with cell-to-cell transmission and a non-cytolytic cure in the presence of humoral immunity,"Sonjoy Pan, Siddhartha P Chakrabarty",2018/8/1,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,61.0,,Elsevier,"A mathematical model for HCV infection, which incorporates both the routes of infection spread, namely, virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell transmission along with a cure rate of infected cells through the non-cytolytic process, is presented. In addition, the model also includes the effect of humoral immune response using a nonlinear activation rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model for HCV dynamics which incorporates both the cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission as well as cure rate within the same model, in addition to antibody being a part of the model setup. The non-negativity and boundedness of solutions of the model system are established and the basic as well as viral reproduction number is determined. The local and global stability analysis of the three equilibria, namely, disease-free, immune response free and infected equilibrium with humoral immune response are investigated theoretically as …",40,"Threshold dynamics of HCV model with cell-to-cell transmission and a non-cytolytic cure in the presence of humoral immunity
