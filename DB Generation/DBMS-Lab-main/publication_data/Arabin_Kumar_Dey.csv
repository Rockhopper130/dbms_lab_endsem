Confidence Interval Construction for Multivariate time series using Long Short Term Memory Network,"Aryan Bhambu, Arabin Kumar Dey",2022/11/25,arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.13915,,,,In this paper we propose a novel procedure to construct a confidence interval for multivariate time series predictions using long short term memory network. The construction uses a few novel block bootstrap techniques. We also propose an innovative block length selection procedure for each of these schemes. Two novel benchmarks help us to compare the construction of this confidence intervals by different bootstrap techniques. We illustrate the whole construction through S\&P and Dow Jones Index datasets.,0,"Confidence Interval Construction for Multivariate time series using Long Short Term Memory Network

Integrated Brier Score based Survival Cobra--A regression based approach,"Rahul Goswami, Arabin Kumar Dey",2022/10/21,arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.12006,,,,"In this paper, we provide two novel regression-based integrations of combined regression strategy (COBRA) ensemble using Integrated Brier Score to predict conditional survival function. Our proposition includes a weighted version of all predictions based on Integrated Brier Score score made by all weak learners to predict the final survival function apart from the straight implementation. Two different norms (Frobenius and Sup norm) used to figure out the proximity points in the algorithm. Our implementations consider right-censored data too. We illustrate the proposed algorithms through few real-life data analysis.",0,"Integrated Brier Score based Survival Cobra--A regression based approach

Controlling Travel Path of Original Cobra,"Mriganka Basu RoyChowdhury, Arabin K Dey",2022/10/15,arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.10655,,,,In this paper we propose a kernel based COBRA which is a direct approximation of the original COBRA. We propose a novel tuning procedure for original COBRA parameters based on this kernel approximation. We show that our proposed algorithm provides much better accuracy than other COBRAs and faster than usual Gridsearch COBRA. We use two datasets to illustrate our proposed methodology over existing COBRAs.,0,"Controlling Travel Path of Original Cobra

Concordance based Survival Cobra with regression type weak learners,"Rahul Goswami, Arabin Kumar Dey",2022/9/24,arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.11919,,,,"In this paper, we predict conditional survival functions through a combined regression strategy. We take weak learners as different random survival trees. We propose to maximize concordance in the right-censored set up to find the optimal parameters. We explore two approaches, a usual survival cobra and a novel weighted predictor based on the concordance index. Our proposed formulations use two different norms, say, Max-norm and Frobenius norm, to find a proximity set of predictions from query points in the test dataset. We illustrate our algorithms through three different real-life dataset implementations.",0,"Concordance based Survival Cobra with regression type weak learners

Modeling long-term groundwater levels by exploring deep bidirectional long short-term memory using hydro-climatic data,"Sangita Dey, Arabin Kumar Dey, Rajesh Kumar Mall",2021/8,Water Resources Management,35.0,,Springer Netherlands,"Inevitable issues concerning the sustainability of groundwater resources are crucial under the present climatic situation. Therefore, the prevision of groundwater environments may able to reinforce the management system. In this respect present study considered a new method to predict long-term groundwater level framework as an alternative option of expensive physical models. The proposed Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) model can efficiently capture Spatio-temporal features from historical data. A highway LSTM network is also introduced within the architecture of the model to optimize the analysis. The relative performance of the proposed BLSTM with the highway LSTM (BHLSTM) network compared with simple BLSTM. Stack size increment of the BHLSTM and BLSTM layers can enhance the learning ability and improve by incorporating straight LSTM at the top of the architecture …",10,"Modeling long-term groundwater levels by exploring deep bidirectional long short-term memory using hydro-climatic data

Construction of confidence interval for a univariate stock price signal predicted through long short term memory network,"Shankhajyoti De, Arabin Kumar Dey, Deepak Kumar Gouda",2020/7/22,Annals of Data Science,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"In this paper, we show an innovative way to construct bootstrap confidence interval of a signal estimated based on a univariate LSTM model. We take three different types of bootstrap methods for dependent set up. We prescribe some useful suggestions to select the optimal block length while performing the bootstrapping of the sample.

Fate of Snakes in an Urban Landscape-A,"D Gayen, S Dey, AK Dey, US Roy",2019,,,,,"Materials and Methods
Study Site: The present study was carried out in Durgapur, also known as ‘steel city’of West Bengal, India. The city covers an area of 154 km2 and is situated at the transition zone between Chotanagpur plateau and Gangetic plains (23.480N, 87.320E, elevation 65 m MSL). The region is represented by dry deciduous forest of Shorea robusta (Champion & Seth 1968), scrubland and a few agricultural lands of poor laterite soil. Presently the landscape has been changed by various human activities and has a large number of small and heavy industries which includes the Durgapur Steel Plant, Alloy Steel Plant, Durgapur Thermal Power Station and Durgapur Projects Limited. A large dam and various reserves have been constructed for water supply and flood control for the inhabitants of Durgapur and its surrounding regions. The city is both interspersed and surrounded by several forest patches (Nayak & Roy 2016).
Data Collection: The present study is the outcome of a survey where information regarding snake-human conflict was gathered primarily from the snake rescue groups.",0,"Fate of Snakes in an Urban Landscape-A

We implement the same in MovieLens small dataset. We also tune the hyper parameter by using a modified empirical bayes.
