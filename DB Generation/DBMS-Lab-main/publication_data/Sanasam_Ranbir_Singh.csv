SwitchNet: Learning to switch for word-level language identification in code-mixed social media text,"Neelakshi Sarma, Ranbir Sanasam Singh, Diganta Goswami",2022/5,Natural Language Engineering,28.0,3,Cambridge University Press,"Word-level language identification is an essential prerequisite for extracting useful information from code-mixed social media content. Previous studies in word-level language identification show two important observations. First, the local context is an important indicator of the language of a word when a word is valid in multiple languages. Second, considering the word in isolation from its context leads to more effective language classification when a word is borrowed or embedded into sentences of other languages. In this paper, we propose a framework for language identification that makes use of a dynamic switching mechanism for effective language classification of both words that are borrowed or embedded from other languages as well as words that are valid in multiple languages. For a given input, the proposed switching mechanism makes a dynamic decision to bias its prediction either towards the …",3,"SwitchNet: Learning to switch for word-level language identification in code-mixed social media text

A Hybrid Machine Transliteration Model Based on Multi-source Encoder–Decoder Framework: English to Manipuri,"Lenin Laitonjam, Sanasam Ranbir Singh",2022/3,SN Computer Science,3.0,,Springer Singapore,"In this paper, we propose a neural hybrid machine transliteration model that captures the characteristics of both grapheme and phoneme representations. Unlike previous hybrid models that rely on linear interpolation or statistical correspondence of grapheme and phoneme sequences, the proposed model is based on the popular neural encoder–decoder-based transliteration model. We strengthen the traditional encoder–decoder transliteration models to multi-source framework to take advantage of both grapheme and phoneme sequences. This study investigates the responses of various encoder–decoder neural models integrated with the proposed hybrid model.

As the Assamese WordNet is also built using the expansion method, using the Hindi WordNet, it also has missing synonymy relations. As WordNets can be visualized as a network of unique words connected by synonymy relations, link prediction in complex network analysis is an effective way of predicting missing relations in a network. Hence, to predict the missing synonyms in the Assamese WordNet, link prediction methods were used in the current work that proved effective.

Instead of using language dependent speech-to-text transcribers for language identification, this paper investigates the efficacy of using language independent speech-to-text transcribers (trained on languages different from the target languages) in automatic language identification for various Indian languages (namely Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Gujarati, Manipuri, Mizo, Tamil and Telegu) deploying various text classification methods. It further compares the performances obtained over text generated by language independent transcribers with that of the classifiers built using audio features and manually transcribed text. From various experimental setups over speech samples recorded under controlled (studio recorded) and uncontrolled environment (outdoor recording), it is evident that transcription text using language independent transcriber can effectively be used for spoken language identification tasks..",0,"Effectiveness of using language independent transcribers for spoken language identification for different Indian languages

Absence of CD 9 expression in acute myeloid leukemia: possible correlation with t (8; 21),"S Singh, Amit Bhattacharya",,,,,,"The pore conformation of polymeric membranes can be significantly altered upon interaction of the membranes with organic solvents affecting the performances of the membranes. Polymer shows swelling properties to organic solvents. Here, we show that swelling properties of polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane can be significantly altered by hexane treatment resulting in a change in the pure water permeability, macromolecule separation, and porosity. The water permeability of the membranes decreased with the dipping time in hexane. It showed that the rate of decrement in water permeability was about ten times for PS-24 (prepared from 24%, w/w solution in DMF) compared to PS-15 (prepared from 15%, w/w solution in DMF) while the% solute (macromolecule) rejection was decreased by about 11–17% for the membranes.

Nano-formulations of arteether have been developed. The relative bioavailability (RB%) was assessed by calculating individual AUC0‒t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax values. Haematological, biochemical parameters were estimated in rats 15 and sections of brain and peripheral organs were analyzed for histopathological changes. The formulations were tested for antimalarial efficacy and safety in Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis infected swiss mice. The AUC in case of lipid formulations (AUC0-t 4.98±0.79 h. µg/ml) and AUC0-∞(5.02±0.80 h. µg/ml) 20 were significantly higher (p< 0.05) than AE in ground nut oil (GNO) and AE aqueous suspension. The Cmax was also significantly higher for all the formulations. The RB% has been found to be significantly high (257%) in formulations with respect to AE in GNO. No considerable changes have been 25 monitored in the serum biochemical parameters in rats. These formulations have been found to be highly effective against Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis infected swiss mice even at the lower dose of 12.5 mg/kg x5 days. Overall the developed formulations are safe and provide a non-toxic platform for further 30 clinical studies and can be used in artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).

An approach for grammatical constructs of Sanskrit language using morpheme and parts-of-speech tagging by Sanskrit corpus,"Shail Prakash Singh, Rashmi Pandey",,,,,,"Time-domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) has advantages in spectral efficiency and synchronization. However, its iterative interference cancellation algorithm will suffer from performance loss especially under severely fading channels with long delays and has difficulty supporting high-order modulations like 256 QAM, which may not accommodate the emerging ultra-high definition television service. To solve this problem, a channel estimation method for OFDM under the framework of compressive sensing (CS) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, by exploiting the signal structure of recently proposed time-frequency training OFDM scheme, the auxiliary channel information is obtained. Secondly, we propose the auxiliary information based subspace pursuit (A-SP) algorithm to utilize a very small amount of frequency domain pilots embedded in the OFDM block for the exact channel estimation. Moreover, the obtained auxiliary channel information is adopted to reduce the complexity of the classical SP algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the CS-based OFDM outperforms the conventional dual pseudo noise padded OFDM and CS-based TDS-OFDM schemes in both static and mobile environments, especially when the channel length is close to or even larger than the guard interval length, where the conventional schemes fail to work completely.",0,"Compressive Sensing for OFDM Systems Based Channel Estimation under Long Delay Channels

Practically the RW is assumed to offer better storing facilities than the OW, which results in a lower rate of deterioration and is supposed to charge higher holding cost than the OW. In this paper a two-warehouse inventory model for deteriorating items is considered with linearly time varying demand under the permissible delay in payments. Also we assumed that the interest charged by the supplier after trade credit period is not necessarily higher than the interest earned as the retailer may invest the revenue in different schemes that may give better return (eg in share market, mutual fund, real estate etc). The purpose of this paper is to find the optimal replenishment policy to minimize the total relevant inventory cost. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the proposed model.

Secure and efficient integrity algorithm based on existing SHA algorithms,"SP Singh, RK Tripathi",,,,,,"A major drawback in case of three-level PWM rectifiers is unbalance in DC-bus capacitor voltage which is further aggravated under unbalanced load conditions. The DC-bus capacitor voltage unbalancing is created due to irregular charging and discharging of the capacitor which is originated by asymmetric connections produced by power semiconductor devices in the converter. The capacitor voltage unbalancing has become a burning issue and has invited an intensive research to address this problem in multilevel inverters. The key aspect in the behavior of multilevel rectifiers is to avoid the unbalance in DC-bus capacitor voltages.
In the proposed work, a linear controller is used to control the total DC-bus voltage in a similar fashion as in twolevel PWM rectifiers. A non-linear controller is proposed to achieve the balancing of the DC-bus capacitor voltages. In fact, the mechanism which generates the DC-bus capacitor voltage unbalancing is studied and is used to develop the proposed control algorithm. The redundant switching vectors are used for achieving the capacitor voltage balancing.

Despite numerous advantages, these power electronic systems suffer from serious problem like drawing harmonic current and reactive component of the current from source and offer highly nonlinear characteristic. Current harmonics generated by these nonlinear loads further results in voltage distortion at the point of common coupling and this distortion in voltage is becoming troublesome for the operation of many sensitive equipment and other consumer loads.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique like Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been elegantly used for better performance and control of the rectifier. In order to avoid the need for a DSP by avoiding the online timing computations for various voltage space vectors in various regions and sectors and produce higher pulse resolution, an ANN-based SVPWM technique is proposed in this paper.

Adherence to antiretroviral therapy is the most powerful predictor of survival for people living with HIV/AIDS. Authorities have assumed that adherence in Africa would be sub-optimal, which, in some circumstances, has led to restrictions in access to antiretroviral drugs. We reviewed the available evidence regarding adherence to antiretroviral therapy in Africa versus North America.
Methods: We searched 11 electronic databases, major conference abstract databases, contacted researchers, treatment and advocacy groups, and searched the Internet. We selected studies of mixed populations in both North America and Africa. We abstracted data in duplicate on study adherence outcomes, thresholds used to determine adherence and characteristics of the populations.

When these nodes combine they form a network. The VANET comes under the MANET as one of its type. The smart cars in VANET moves freely in the city area. There are two types of communication possible in VANET ie vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure. The smart cars ie the intelligent vehicles are defined respective to their distance, direction and speed analysis. If there is any accident happened in that network then the node sends this information to its neighbour node and like this the information is spread in all over the network. Similarly at the time of handoff one RSU sends the information to next RSU, so that the required information of node’s speed, directions, distance is known to the RSU in advance and hence help in reducing the delay at the time of handoff. In this there is a RSU which is attached to the main server. The vehicles communicate with radio waves and vehicle send the information of accident to the RSU which transfers it to the main server and the main server broadcast it to the other RSUs so that all the mobile nodes get this information. The servers replicate and send this information to all vehicles and the vehicles can change their direction and choose other path to reach their destination. In this paper, beacon frame range of RSU and threshold value has been discussed which helps in creating a synchronized relationship between road side unit which can help in reducing delay of packets and increasing throughput at the time of handoff of node from one road side unit to next road side unit.",0,"A Novel Delay Optimization Technique in VANET using Beacon Frame Range

In addition, cube specimens of size 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm were also tested on 2000 kN compression testing machine to obtain compressive strength of specimens. The mix containing different fibre volume fractions of steel fibres at 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5%, each volume fraction incorporating 15%, 30% and 45% fly ash as partial replacement of cement were prepared. In addition, a few SCC (no fibres) mixes containing 15%, 30% and 45% fly ash as partial replacement of cement were also prepared. The flexural toughness parameters were obtained using procedure laid down in ASTM C-1018, JCI Method and ASTM C-1609/M.

Studies on the Leachate Characteristics of Compacted Fly Ash Bed Treated with Lime Column,"MD Newlands, Ravindra K Dhir, SP Singh",,,,,,"The paper is concerned with selecting materials for concrete that is both durable and sustainable and the issues associated with achieving this. The paper starts by reviewing the current situation in standards and then progresses to consider the work of several studies exploring sustainability options for concrete (through novel cement combinations, efficiency in mix proportioning and alternative aggregates) and their influence on various aspects of durability (including carbonation rates, chloride ingress and freeze/thaw attack). It is demonstrated that these can be used to effectively match the performance of conventional concrete. The paper then explores the relationship between durability (chloride ingress) of various cement combination concretes and their environmental impact (measured in terms of embodied CO2 (ECO2)). This suggests that there is likely to be the need for some compromise in achieving performance and lowest ECO2. It is also noted that some of the low ECO2 concretes require longer times to attain the early strength necessary for structural applications. Thus factors relating to construction may also need to be included when considering durability and sustainability in the material selection process.",0,"COMBINING DURABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY IN MATERIAL SELECTION FOR CONCRETE

The prime objective of economic dispatch is to minimize total cost of generation while honouring operational constraints of available generation resources. In this paper an intelligent water drop (IWD) algorithm has been proposed to solve ELD problem with an objective of minimizing the total cost of generation. Intelligent water drop algorithm is a swarm-based nature-inspired optimization algorithm, which has been inspired from natural rivers. A natural river often finds good paths among lots of possible paths in its ways from source to destination and finally find almost optimal path to their destination. These ideas are embedded into the proposed algorithm for solving economic load dispatch problem. The main advantage of the proposed technique is easy to put into practice and capable of finding feasible near global optimal solution with less computational effort. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it has been tested on 6-unit system. Arithmetical results show that the proposed method has good convergence property and better in quality of solution than PSO reported in recent literature.",0,"Intelligent Water Drop and Swarm
