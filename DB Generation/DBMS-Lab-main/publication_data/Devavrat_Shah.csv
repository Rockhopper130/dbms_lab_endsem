Implicit feedback policies for COVID-19: why “zero-COVID” policies remain elusive,"Ali Jadbabaie, Arnab Sarker, Devavrat Shah",2023/2/23,Scientific Reports,13.0,1,Nature Publishing Group UK,"Successful epidemic modeling requires understanding the implicit feedback control strategies used by populations to modulate the spread of contagion. While such strategies can be replicated with intricate modeling assumptions, here we propose a simple model where infection dynamics are described by a three parameter feedback policy. Rather than model individuals as directly controlling the contact rate which governs the spread of disease, we model them as controlling the contact rate’s derivative, resulting in a dynamic rather than kinematic model. The feedback policy used by populations across the United States which best fits observations is proportional-derivative control, where learned parameters strongly correlate with observed interventions (e.g., vaccination rates and mobility restrictions). However, this results in a non-zero “steady-state” of case counts, implying current mitigation strategies cannot …",0,"Implicit feedback policies for COVID-19: why “zero-COVID” policies remain elusive

Matrix Estimation for Individual Fairness,"Cindy Y Zhang, Sarah H Cen, Devavrat Shah",2023/2/4,arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.02096,,,,"In recent years, multiple notions of algorithmic fairness have arisen. One such notion is individual fairness (IF), which requires that individuals who are similar receive similar treatment. In parallel, matrix estimation (ME) has emerged as a natural paradigm for handling noisy data with missing values. In this work, we connect the two concepts. We show that pre-processing data using ME can improve an algorithm's IF without sacrificing performance. Specifically, we show that using a popular ME method known as singular value thresholding (SVT) to pre-process the data provides a strong IF guarantee under appropriate conditions. We then show that, under analogous conditions, SVT pre-processing also yields estimates that are consistent and approximately minimax optimal. As such, the ME pre-processing step does not, under the stated conditions, increase the prediction error of the base algorithm, i.e., does not impose a fairness-performance trade-off. We verify these results on synthetic and real data.",0,"Matrix Estimation for Individual Fairness

Robust Max Entrywise Error Bounds for Tensor Estimation from Sparse Observations via Similarity Based Collaborative Filtering,"Devavrat Shah, Christina Lee Yu",2023/1/16,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,,,IEEE,"Consider the task of estimating a 3-order n × n × n tensor from noisy observations of randomly chosen entries in the sparse regime. We introduce a similarity based collaborative filtering algorithm for estimating a tensor from sparse observations and argue that it achieves sample complexity that nearly matches the conjectured computationally efficient lower bound on the sample complexity for the setting of low-rank tensors. Our algorithm uses the matrix obtained from the flattened tensor to compute similarity, and estimates the tensor entries using a nearest neighbor estimator. We prove that the algorithm recovers a finite rank tensor with maximum entry-wise error (MEE) and mean-squared-error (MSE) decaying to 0 as long as each entry is observed independently with probability p = Ω( n –3/2+κ ) for any arbitrarily small κ > 0.

We consider studies with unobserved confounding which introduces statistical biases between interventions and outcomes as well as exacerbates the heterogeneity across units. Modeling the underlying joint distribution as an exponential family and under suitable conditions, we reduce learning the unit-level counterfactual distributions to learning exponential family distributions with heterogeneous parameters and only one sample per distribution. We introduce a convex objective that pools all samples to jointly learn all parameters and provide a unit-wise mean squared error bound that scales linearly with the metric entropy of the parameter space. For example, when the parameters are -sparse linear combination of known vectors, the error is .

Causal imputation via synthetic interventions,"Chandler Squires, Dennis Shen, Anish Agarwal, Devavrat Shah, Caroline Uhler",2022/6/28,,,,PMLR,"Consider the problem of determining the effect of a compound on a specific cell type. To answer this question, researchers traditionally need to run an experiment applying the drug of interest to that cell type. This approach is not scalable: given a large number of different actions (compounds) and a large number of different contexts (cell types), it is infeasible to run an experiment for every action-context pair. In such cases, one would ideally like to predict the outcome for every pair while only needing outcome data for a small _subset_ of pairs. This task, which we label"" causal imputation"", is a generalization of the causal transportability problem. To address this challenge, we extend the recently introduced _synthetic interventions_ (SI) estimator to handle more general data sparsity patterns. We prove that, under a latent factor model, our estimator provides valid estimates for the causal imputation task. We motivate this model by establishing a connection to the linear structural causal model literature. Finally, we consider the prominent CMAP dataset in predicting the effects of compounds on gene expression across cell types. We find that our estimator outperforms standard baselines, thus confirming its utility in biological applications.",12,"Causal imputation via synthetic interventions

In this paper, we leverage such low-rank structure to reduce the high computational cost of canonical gradient-based methods such as gradient descent (GD). Our proposed \emph{Low-Rank Gradient Descent} (LRGD) algorithm finds an -approximate stationary point of a -dimensional function by first identifying significant directions, and then estimating the true -dimensional gradient at every iteration by computing directional derivatives only along those directions. We establish that the ""directional oracle complexities"" of LRGD for strongly convex and non-convex objective functions are and , respectively. When , these complexities are smaller than the known complexities of and of {\gd} in the strongly convex and non-convex settings, respectively.

Such knowledge is generally acquired through costly trial and error, but this learning process can be disrupted by competition. In this work, we study how competition affects the long-term outcomes of individuals as they learn. We build on a line of work that models this setting as a two-sided matching market with bandit learners. A recent result in this area states that it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee two natural desiderata: stability and low optimal regret for all agents. Resource-allocating platforms can point to this result as a justification for assigning good long-term outcomes to some agents and poor ones to others. We show that this impossibility need not hold true. In particular, by modeling two additional components of competition—namely, costs and transfers—we prove that it is possible to simultaneously guarantee four desiderata: stability, low optimal regret, fairness in the distribution of regret, and high social welfare.",22,"Regret, stability & fairness in matching markets with bandit learners

Current Implicit Policies May Not Eradicate COVID-19,"Ali Jadbabaie, Arnab Sarker, Devavrat Shah",2022/3/29,arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.15916,,,,"Successful predictive modeling of epidemics requires an understanding of the implicit feedback control strategies which are implemented by populations to modulate the spread of contagion. While this task of capturing endogenous behavior can be achieved through intricate modeling assumptions, we find that a population's reaction to case counts can be described through a second order affine dynamical system with linear control which fits well to the data across different regions and times throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The model fits the data well both in and out of sample across the 50 states of the United States, with comparable scores to state of the art ensemble predictions. In contrast to recent models of epidemics, rather than assuming that individuals directly control the contact rate which governs the spread of disease, we assume that individuals control the rate at which they vary their number of interactions, i.e. they control the derivative of the contact rate. We propose an implicit feedback law for this control input and verify that it correlates with policies taken throughout the pandemic. A key takeaway of the dynamical model is that the ""stable"" point of case counts is non-zero, i.e. COVID-19 will not be eradicated under the current collection of policies and strategies, and additional policies are needed to fully eradicate it quickly. Hence, we suggest alternative implicit policies which focus on making interventions (such as vaccinations and mobility restrictions) a function of cumulative case counts, for which our results suggest a better possibility of eradicating COVID-19.",0,"Current Implicit Policies May Not Eradicate COVID-19

Counterfactual inference for sequential experimental design,"Raaz Dwivedi, Susan Murphy, Devavrat Shah",2022/2/14,arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.06891,,,,"We consider the problem of counterfactual inference in sequentially designed experiments wherein a collection of units each undergo a sequence of interventions for time periods, based on policies that sequentially adapt over time. Our goal is counterfactual inference, i.e., estimate what would have happened if alternate policies were used, a problem that is inherently challenging due to the heterogeneity in the outcomes across units and time. To tackle this task, we introduce a suitable latent factor model where the potential outcomes are determined by exogenous unit and time level latent factors. Under suitable conditions, we show that it is possible to estimate the missing (potential) outcomes using a simple variant of nearest neighbors. First, assuming a bilinear latent factor model and allowing for an arbitrary adaptive sampling policy, we establish a distribution-free non-asymptotic guarantee for estimating the missing outcome of any unit at any time; under suitable regularity condition, this guarantee implies that our estimator is consistent. Second, for a generic non-parametric latent factor model, we establish that the estimate for the missing outcome of any unit at time satisfies a central limit theorem as , under suitable regularity conditions. Finally, en route to establishing this central limit theorem, we establish a non-asymptotic mean-squared-error bound for the estimate of the missing outcome of any unit at time .

Unifying Epidemic Models with Mixtures,"Arnab Sarker, Ali Jadbabaie, Devavrat Shah",2022/1/7,arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.04960,,,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for a robust understanding of epidemic models. Current models of epidemics are classified as either mechanistic or non-mechanistic: mechanistic models make explicit assumptions on the dynamics of disease, whereas non-mechanistic models make assumptions on the form of observed time series. Here, we introduce a simple mixture-based model which bridges the two approaches while retaining benefits of both.

Federated optimization of smooth loss functions,"Ali Jadbabaie, Anuran Makur, Devavrat Shah",2022/1/6,arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.01954,,,,"In this work, we study empirical risk minimization (ERM) within a federated learning framework, where a central server minimizes an ERM objective function using training data that is stored across clients. In this setting, the Federated Averaging (FedAve) algorithm is the staple for determining -approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this additional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent (FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank structure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server can use to approximate clients' gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM problem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can have superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle complexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity. Under some assumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity in parameter, -H\""older smoothness in data, etc., we prove that the federated oracle complexity of FedLRGD scales like and that of FedAve scales like (neglecting sub-dominant factors), where is a ""communication-to-computation ratio,"" is the parameter dimension, and is the data dimension.

Causalsim: Toward a causal data-driven simulator for network protocols,"Abdullah Alomar, Pouya Hamadanian, Arash Nasr-Esfahany, Anish Agarwal, Mohammad Alizadeh, Devavrat Shah",2022/1/5,arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.01811,,,,"Evaluating the real-world performance of network protocols is challenging. Randomized control trials (RCT) are expensive and inaccessible to most researchers, while expert-designed simulators fail to capture complex behaviors in real networks. We present CausalSim, a data-driven simulator for network protocols that addresses this challenge. Learning network behavior from observational data is complicated due to the bias introduced by the protocols used during data collection. CausalSim uses traces from an initial RCT under a set of protocols to learn a causal network model, effectively removing the biases present in the data. Using this model, CausalSim can then simulate any protocol over the same traces (i.e., for counterfactual predictions). Key to CausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits distributional invariances that are present due to the training data coming from an RCT. Our extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic datasets and two use cases, including more than nine months of real data from the Puffer video streaming system, shows that it provides accurate counterfactual predictions, reducing prediction error by 44% and 53% on average compared to expert-designed and standard supervised learning baselines.",3,"Causalsim: Toward a causal data-driven simulator for network protocols

Current Implicit Policies May Not Eradicate COVID-19 (preprint),"Ali Jadbabaie, Arnab Sarker, Devavrat Shah",2022,,,,,"Successful predictive modeling of epidemics requires an understanding of the implicit feedback control strategies which are implemented by populations to modulate the spread of contagion. While this task of capturing endogenous behavior can be achieved through intricate modeling assumptions, we find that a population's reaction to case counts can be described through a second order affine dynamical system with linear control which fits well to the data across different regions and times throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The model fits the data well both in and out of sample across the 50 states of the United States, with comparable scores to state of the art ensemble predictions. In contrast to recent models of epidemics, rather than assuming that individuals directly control the contact rate which governs the spread of disease, we assume that individuals control the rate at which they vary their number of interactions, ie they control the derivative of the contact rate. We propose an implicit feedback law for this control input and verify that it correlates with policies taken throughout the pandemic. A key takeaway of the dynamical model is that the"" stable"" point of case counts is non-zero, ie COVID-19 will not be eradicated under the current collection of policies and strategies, and additional policies are needed to fully eradicate it quickly. Hence, we suggest alternative implicit policies which focus on making interventions (such as vaccinations and mobility restrictions) a function of cumulative case counts, for which our results suggest a better possibility of eradicating COVID-19.",0,"Current Implicit Policies May Not Eradicate COVID-19 (preprint)

To answer this question, researchers traditionally need to run an experiment applying the drug of interest to that cell type. This approach is not scalable: given a large number of different actions (compounds) and a large number of different contexts (cell types), it is infeasible to run an experiment for every action-context pair. In such cases, one would ideally like to predict the outcome for every pair while only needing outcome data for a small _subset_ of pairs. This task, which we label ""causal imputation"", is a generalization of the causal transportability problem. To address this challenge, we extend the recently introduced _synthetic interventions_ (SI) estimator to handle more general data sparsity patterns. We prove that, under a latent factor model, our estimator provides valid estimates for the causal imputation task. We motivate this model by establishing a connection to the linear structural causal model literature. Finally, we consider the prominent CMAP dataset in predicting the effects of compounds on gene expression across cell types.

Change Point Detection via Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis,"Arwa Alanqary, Abdullah Alomar, Devavrat Shah",2021/12/6,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,34.0,,,"The objective of change point detection (CPD) is to detect significant and abrupt changes in the dynamics of the underlying system of interest through multivariate time series observations. In this work, we develop and analyze an algorithm for CPD that is inspired by a variant of the classical singular spectrum analysis (SSA) approach for time series by combining it with the classical cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic from sequential hypothesis testing. In particular, we model the underlying dynamics of multivariate time series observations through the spatio-temporal model introduced recently in the multivariate SSA (mSSA) literature. The change point in such a setting corresponds to a change in the underlying spatio-temporal model. As the primary contributions of this work, we develop an algorithm based on CUSUM-statistic to detect such change points in an online fashion. We extend the analysis of CUSUM statistics, traditionally done for the setting of independent observations, to the dependent setting of (multivariate) time series under the spatio-temporal model. Specifically, for a given parameter , our method achieves the following desirable trade-off: when a change happens, it detects it within time delay on average, while in the absence of change, it does not declare false detection for at least time length on average. We conduct empirical experiments using benchmark and synthetic datasets.

This influence has drawn scrutiny, with many calling for regulations on filtering algorithms, but designing and enforcing regulations remains challenging. In this work, we examine three questions. First, given a regulation, how would one design an audit to enforce it? Second, does the audit impose a performance cost on the platform? Third, how does the audit affect the content that the platform is incentivized to filter? In response to these questions, we propose a method such that, given a regulation, an auditor can test whether that regulation is met with only black-box access to the filtering algorithm. We then turn to the platform's perspective. The platform's goal is to maximize an objective function while meeting regulation. We find that there are conditions under which the regulation does not place a high performance cost on the platform and, notably, that content diversity can play a key role in aligning the interests of the platform and regulators.",13,"Regulating algorithmic filtering on social media

Causal matrix completion,"Anish Agarwal, Munther Dahleh, Devavrat Shah, Dennis Shen",2021/9/30,arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.15154,,,,"Matrix completion is the study of recovering an underlying matrix from a sparse subset of noisy observations. Traditionally, it is assumed that the entries of the matrix are ""missing completely at random"" (MCAR), i.e., each entry is revealed at random, independent of everything else, with uniform probability. This is likely unrealistic due to the presence of ""latent confounders"", i.e., unobserved factors that determine both the entries of the underlying matrix and the missingness pattern in the observed matrix. For example, in the context of movie recommender systems -- a canonical application for matrix completion -- a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is unlikely to ever watch horror films. In general, these confounders yield ""missing not at random"" (MNAR) data, which can severely impact any inference procedure that does not correct for this bias. We develop a formal causal model for matrix completion through the language of potential outcomes, and provide novel identification arguments for a variety of causal estimands of interest. We design a procedure, which we call ""synthetic nearest neighbors"" (SNN), to estimate these causal estimands. We prove finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator. Our analysis also leads to new theoretical results for the matrix completion literature. In particular, we establish entry-wise, i.e., max-norm, finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality results for matrix completion with MNAR data. As a special case, this also provides entry-wise bounds for matrix completion with MCAR data.

Gradient-based empirical risk minimization using local polynomial regression,"Ali Jadbabaie, Anuran Makur, Devavrat Shah",2020/11/4,arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.02522,,,,"In this paper, we consider the problem of empirical risk minimization (ERM) of smooth, strongly convex loss functions using iterative gradient-based methods. A major goal of this literature has been to compare different algorithms, such as gradient descent (GD) or stochastic gradient descent (SGD), by analyzing their rates of convergence to -approximate solutions. For example, the oracle complexity of GD is , where is the number of training samples. When is large, this can be expensive in practice, and SGD is preferred due to its oracle complexity of . Such standard analyses only utilize the smoothness of the loss function in the parameter being optimized. In contrast, we demonstrate that when the loss function is smooth in the data, we can learn the oracle at every iteration and beat the oracle complexities of both GD and SGD in important regimes. Specifically, at every iteration, our proposed algorithm performs local polynomial regression to learn the gradient of the loss function, and then estimates the true gradient of the ERM objective function. We establish that the oracle complexity of our algorithm scales like (neglecting sub-dominant factors), where and are the data and parameter space dimensions, respectively, and the gradient of the loss function belongs to a -H\""{o}lder class with respect to the data. Our proof extends the analysis of local polynomial regression in non-parametric statistics to provide interpolation guarantees in multivariate settings, and also exploits tools from the inexact GD literature. Unlike GD and SGD, the complexity of our method depends on and . However, when is small and the loss …",3,"Gradient-based empirical risk minimization using local polynomial regression

On principal component regression in a high-dimensional error-in-variables setting,"Anish Agarwal, Devavrat Shah, Dennis Shen",2020/10/27,arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.14449,,,,"We analyze the classical method of principal component regression (PCR) in a high-dimensional error-in-variables setting. Here, the observed covariates are not only noisy and contain missing values, but the number of covariates can also exceed the sample size. Under suitable conditions, we establish that PCR identifies the unique linear model parameter with minimum -norm, and derive non-asymptotic -rates of convergence that show its consistency. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm for out-of-sample predictions in the presence of corrupted data that uses PCR as a key subroutine, and provide its non-asymptotic prediction performance guarantees. Notably, our results do not require the out-of-samples covariates to follow the same distribution as that of the in-sample covariates, but rather that they obey a simple linear algebraic constraint.

On May 4, 2020, India started the process of releasing its population from a national lockdown during which extreme social distancing was implemented. We describe and simulate an adaptive control approach to exit this situation, while maintaining the epidemic under control. Adaptive control is a flexible countercyclical policy approach, whereby different areas release from lockdown in potentially different gradual ways, dependent on the local progression of the dis-ease. Because of these features, adaptive control requires the ability to decrease or increase social distancing in response to observed and projected dynamics of the disease outbreak. We show via simulation of a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and of a synthetic intervention (SI) model that adaptive control performs at least as well as immediate and full release from lockdown starting May 4 and as full release from lockdown after a month (ie, after May 31). The key insight is that adaptive response provides the option to increase or decrease socioeconomic activity depending on how it affects disease progression and this freedom allows it to do at least as well as most other policy alternatives. We also discuss the central challenge to any nuanced release policy, including adaptive control, specifically learning how specific policies translate into changes in contact rates and thus COVID-19's reproductive rate in real time.",20,"Adaptive control of COVID-19 outbreaks in India: Local, gradual, and trigger-based exit paths from lockdown

Stable reinforcement learning with unbounded state space,"Devavrat Shah, Qiaomin Xie, Zhi Xu",2020/6/8,arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.04353,,,,"We consider the problem of reinforcement learning (RL) with unbounded state space motivated by the classical problem of scheduling in a queueing network. Traditional policies as well as error metric that are designed for finite, bounded or compact state space, require infinite samples for providing any meaningful performance guarantee (e.g. error) for unbounded state space. That is, we need a new notion of performance metric. As the main contribution of this work, inspired by the literature in queuing systems and control theory, we propose stability as the notion of ""goodness"": the state dynamics under the policy should remain in a bounded region with high probability. As a proof of concept, we propose an RL policy using Sparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle and argue that it satisfies the stability property as long as the system dynamics under the optimal policy respects a Lyapunov function. The assumption of existence of a Lyapunov function is not restrictive as it is equivalent to the positive recurrence or stability property of any Markov chain, i.e., if there is any policy that can stabilize the system then it must possess a Lyapunov function. And, our policy does not utilize the knowledge of the specific Lyapunov function. To make our method sample efficient, we provide an improved, sample efficient Sparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle with Lipschitz value function that may be of interest in its own right. Furthermore, we design an adaptive version of the algorithm, based on carefully constructed statistical tests, which finds the correct tuning parameter automatically.",5,"Stable reinforcement learning with unbounded state space

We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist, the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the method leverages information from different interventions that have already been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility restrictions to create a ""synthetic low mobility U.S."" and predict the counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar intervention.

Is it luck or skill: establishing role of skill in mutual fund management and fantasy sports,"Vishal Misra, Devavrat Shah, VS Ranganathan",2020,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,,,,"The emergence of Online Fantasy Sports Platforms (OFSP) has presented a challenge for the regulatory bodies across the globe: do they represent game of skill or game of chance? A game of skill is a game where the outcome is determined mainly by the predominance of mental or physical skill, rather than chance. Gambling or a game of chance is where outcomes are entirely driven by luck and skill has no role to play. In this work, we present a novel data-driven test that helps address this question. In particular, the failure of the test leads to the conclusion that the outcomes are based on the predominance of skill, and not based on luck.
The proposed test is based on a sound statistical hypothesis of chance that we introduce. It is robust against all sorts of biases that might be present in the data. We apply the test to data obtained from two fantasy sports platforms: Dream11 for Cricket and FanDuel for Basketball. In both cases, we conclude that there is overwhelming evidence that the outcomes are driven by the predominance of skill. Indeed, evidence of “survivor bias” can be found in such dataset suggesting the importance of a robust statistical approach presented in this work. We report similar observations in the context of mutual fund performances suggesting that they are being managed by skilful fund managers.",2,"Is it luck or skill: establishing role of skill in mutual fund management and fantasy sports

Our algorithm uses the matrix obtained from the flattened tensor to compute similarity, and estimates the tensor entries using a nearest neighbor estimator. We prove that the algorithm recovers a low rank tensor with maximum entry-wise error (MEE) and mean-squared-error (MSE) decaying to as long as each entry is observed independently with probability for any arbitrarily small . % as long as tensor has finite rank . More generally, we establish robustness of the estimator, showing that when arbitrary noise bounded by is added to each observation, the estimation error with respect to MEE and MSE degrades by . Consequently, even if the tensor may not have finite rank but can be approximated within by a finite rank tensor, then the estimation error converges to .

Approximately Reversible Stochastic Processing Networks,Devavrat Shah,2019/7,INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference,,,,"The property of (quasi-)reversibility of Markov chains have led to elegant characterization of steady-state distribution for complex queueing networks, e.g. celebrated Jackson networks, BCMP (Baskett, Chandi, Muntz, Palacois) and Kelly theorem. In a nutshell, despite the complicated interaction, in the steady-state, the queues in such networks exhibit independence and subsequently lead to explicit calculations of distributional properties of the queuing network that may seem impossible at the outset. The model of stochastic processing network (cf. Harrison 2000) captures variety of dynamic resource allocation problems including the flow-level networks used for modeling bandwidth sharing in the Internet, switched networks (cf. Shah, Wischik 2006) for modeling packet scheduling in the Internet router and wireless medium access, and hybrid flow-packet networks for modeling job-and-packet level scheduling in data centers. Unlike before, an appropriate resource allocation or scheduling policy is required in such networks to achieve good performance. Given the complexity, asymptotic analytic approaches such as fluid model or Lyapunov-Foster criteria to establish positive-recurrence and heavy traffic or diffusion approximation to characterize the scaled steady-state distribution became method of choice. A remarkable progress has been made along these lines over the past few decades, but there is a need for much more to match the explicit calculations in the context of reversible networks.

Zorro: A Model Agnostic System to Price Consumer Data,"Anish Agarwal, Munther Dahleh, Devavrat Shah, Dylan Sleeper, Andrew Tsai, Madeline Wong",2019/6/6,arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.02420,,,,"Personal data is essential in showing users targeted ads - the economic backbone of the web. Still, there are major inefficiencies in how data is transacted online: (1) users don't decide what information is released nor get paid for this privacy loss; (2) algorithmic advertisers are stuck in inefficient long-term contracts where they purchase user data without knowing the value it provides. This paper proposes a system, Zorro, which aims to rectify aforementioned two problems. As the main contribution, we provide a natural, 'absolute' definition of 'Value of Data' (VoD) - for any quantity of interest, it is the delta between an individual's value and population mean. The challenge remains how to operationalize this definition, independently of a buyer's model for VoD. We propose a model-agnostic solution, relying on matrix estimation, and use it to estimate click-through-rate (CTR), as an example. Regarding (2), Zorro empowers advertisers to measure value of user data on a query-by-query basis and based only on the increase in accuracy it provides in estimating CTR. In contrast advertisers currently engage in inefficient long-term data contracts with third party data sellers. We highlight two results on a large ad-click dataset: (i) our system has R^2=0.58, in line with best-in-class results for related problems (e.g. content recommendation). Crucially, our system is model-agnostic - we estimate CTR without accessing an advertiser's proprietary models, a required property of any such pricing system;(ii) our experiments show selling user data has incremental value ranging from 30%-69% depending on ad category.

For this setup, we propose an algorithm that utilizes matrix estimation on the corrupted data as a key subroutine, and then performs ordinary least squares regression with the de-noised covariates. If we instantiate the matrix estimation subroutine with hard singular value thresholding (HSVT), then our results indicate that as long as the number of samples scales as ρ− 4r log5 (p), then our in-and out-ofsample prediction error decays to 0 as p→∞; here, ρ represents the fraction of observed (noisy) covariates, r is the (approximate) rank of the true covariate matrix, and p denotes the ambient dimension (number of predictors). As an important byproduct of our approach, we demonstrate that HSVT with regression acts as a form of implicit ℓ0-regularization since HSVT aims to find a lowrank structure within the covariance matrix. Thus, we can view the sparsity of the regression vector as a consequence of the covariate structure rather than a model assumption as is often considered in the literature. Moreover, under HSVT, our finite sample bounds match (up to log4 (p) factors) the best guaranteed sample complexity results in the literature for algorithms that require precise knowledge of the underlying model; we highlight that our approach, in contrast, is model agnostic.

On robustness of principal component regression,"Anish Agarwal, Devavrat Shah, Dennis Shen, Dogyoon Song",2019,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,32.0,,,"Consider the setting of Linear Regression where the observed response variables, in expectation, are linear functions of the p-dimensional covariates. Then to achieve vanishing prediction error, the number of required samples scales faster than pσ2, where σ2 is a bound on the noise variance. In a high-dimensional setting where p is large but the covariates admit a low-dimensional representation (say r≪ p), then Principal Component Regression (PCR), cf.[36], is an effective approach; here, the response variables are regressed with respect to the principal components of the covariates. The resulting number of required samples to achieve vanishing prediction error now scales faster than rσ2 (≪ pσ2). Despite the tremendous utility of PCR, its ability to handle settings with noisy, missing, and mixed (discrete and continuous) valued covariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge, cf.[24]. As the main contribution of this work, we address this challenge by rigorously establishing that PCR is robust to noisy, sparse, and possibly mixed valued covariates. Specifically, under PCR, vanishing prediction error is achieved with the number of samples scaling as r max (σ2, ρ− 4 log5 (p)), where ρ denotes the fraction of observed (noisy) covariates. We establish generalization error bounds on the performance of PCR, which provides a systematic approach in selecting the correct number of components r in a data-driven manner.

Despite the success of RUMs in various domains and the versatility of mixture RUMs to capture the heterogeneity in preferences, there has been only limited progress in learning a mixture of RUMs from partial data such as pairwise comparisons. In contrast, there have been significant advances in terms of learning a single component RUM using pairwise comparisons. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap between mixture learning and single component learning of RUM by developing a `reduction' procedure. We propose to utilize PCA-based spectral clustering that simultaneously `de-noises' pairwise comparison data. We prove that our algorithm manages to cluster the partial data correctly (i.e., comparisons from the same RUM component are grouped in the same cluster) with high probability even when data is generated from a possibly {\em heterogeneous} mixture of well-separated {\em generic} RUMs. Both the time and the sample complexities scale polynomially in model parameters including the number of items. Two key features in the analysis are in establishing (1) a meaningful upper bound on the sub-Gaussian norm for RUM components embedded into the vector space of pairwise marginals and (2) the robustness of PCA with missing values in the sense, which might be of interest in their own right.",2,"Learning RUMs: Reducing Mixture to Single Component via PCA

This monograph aims to explain the success of these methods, both in theory, for which we cover foundational nonasymptotic statistical guarantees on nearest-neighbor-based regression and classification, and in practice, for which we gather prominent methods for approximate nearest neighbor search that have been essential to scaling prediction systems reliant on nearest neighbor analysis to handle massive datasets. Furthermore, we discuss connections to learning distances for use with nearest neighbor methods, including how random decision trees and ensemble methods learn nearest neighbor structure, as well as recent developments in crowdsourcing and graphons.

We begin with the most general of such results for nearest neighbor and related kernel regression and classification in general metric spaces. In such settings in which we assume very little structure, what enables successful prediction is smoothness in the function being estimated for regression, and a low probability of landing near the decision boundary for classification.

Study aimed to evaluate the Computed Tomography (CT) characteristics of SNIP and to correlate these characteristics with the finding of the origins of tumors. Material and Methods: Nasal cavity and paranasal sinus CT images of 38 patients were reviewed retrospectively to detect areas within which there was hyperostosis. We correlate SNIP characteristics with the detection of the origins of tumors described in the corresponding patient's medical records. We also assessed the CT features of hyperostosis according to the origin of tumors.
Result: Surgical evaluation of 29 lesions with hyperostosis in CT images revealed that 23 of these lesions coincided with the virtual origin of tumor. The CT-based determination of the positions of the areas of hyperostosis corresponded to the actual tumor origin in 79.3% of cases. Specifically, in cases with hyperostosis within the maxillary, frontal, posterior and sphenoid, ethmoid sinuses, areas of hyperostosis corresponded to the origin of tumor without detraction. In the evaluation of the CT characteristics of hyperostosis, two patterns of localized bone thickening were noted. Conclusion: A high association between the origin of the SNIP and hyperostosis on CT might facilitate preoperative prediction of tumor origin by rhinologists and radiologists.",1,"Computed Tomography Evaluation of Sinonasal Inverted Papilloma Characteristics with Origins of Tumors

Gradient Descent for Low-Rank Functions,"Devavrat Shah, Dogyoon Song",2018,arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.11917,,,,"We consider the question of learning mixtures of generic sub-gaussian distributions based on observations with missing values. To that end, we utilize a matrix estimation method from literature (soft-or hard-singular value thresholding). Specifically, we stack the observations (with missing values) to form a data matrix and learn a low-rank approximation of it so that the row indices can be correctly clustered to belong to appropriate mixture component using a simple distance-based algorithm. To analyze the performance of this algorithm by quantifying finite sample bound, we extend the result for matrix estimation methods in the literature in two important ways: one, noise across columns is correlated and not independent across all entries of matrix as considered in the literature; two, the performance metric of interest is the maximum i2 row norm error, which is stronger than the traditional mean-squared-error averaged over all entries. Equipped with these advances in the context of matrix estimation, we are able to connect matrix estimation and mixture model learning in the presence of missing data.",5,"Learning mixture model with missing values and its application to rankings

A distinguishing feature of our algorithm is that of de-noising the data matrix via singular value thresholding, which renders our approach robust in multiple facets: it automatically identifies a good subset of donors for the synthetic control, overcomes the challenges of missing data, and continues to work well in settings where covariate information may not be provided.

Sequential experiments in mobile health and digital platforms aim to provide personalized treatments to 𝑁 users over 𝑇 time points using online personalizing algorithms (PAs), eg, bandit or RL algorithms. The PA’s role is to learn user treatment effects and assign personalized treatment over time. The following projects aim to infer if (i) the digital interventions and (ii) the PAs used to assign them are effective at the individual level in sequential experiments. These tasks are challenging due to heterogeneity across users and time, biases due to the PA’s sequential adaptivity, the lack of mechanistic models for treatment effect, and data’s noisiness. For (i), we provide the first guarantee for ITE in sequential experiments using a non-parametric mixed-effect/latent factor model for the potential outcomes and nearest neighbor (NN) estimators.

Despite the good performance of such algorithms, there is usually a lack of theoretical guarantee on their performance. A recently proposed approach to time series imputation uses matrix estimation methods to recover missing values after transforming the time series into a matrix. This approach has exhibited superior performance and provides strong theoretical guarantees of performance for a large class of time series with random missing entries with a certain probability. In this study, we tackle the particular case of missing entries in a time series that form long blocks of consecutive values of different lengths, and we identify the effect of such scenarios, involving missing values, on the accuracy of matrix estimation algorithms for time series imputation. As the main contribution of this work, we propose an extension to the matrix estimation approach to time series imputation by introducing an adaptive algorithm for selecting the shape of the matrix based on the length of consecutive missing values in the time series. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified by testing it on synthetic datasets consisting of a mixture of autoregressive process, finite sum of harmonics, and a linear trend, as well as real world datasets. Our empirical study shows that the proposed adaptive approach enhances the accuracy of imputation compared with the choice of a fixed matrix shape in 89% of the experiments.

This success naturally begs the question whether it is possible to develop similar high-performance reinforcement learning algorithms for generic sequential decision-making problems (beyond two-player games), using only the constraints of the environment as the ``rules.'' To address this challenge, we start by taking steps towards developing a formal understanding of AGZ. AGZ includes two key innovations: (1) it learns a policy (represented as a neural network) using {\em supervised learning} with cross-entropy loss from samples generated via Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS); (2) it uses {\em self-play} to learn without training data. We argue that the self-play in AGZ corresponds to learning a Nash equilibrium for the two-player game; and the supervised learning with MCTS is attempting to learn the policy corresponding to the Nash equilibrium, by establishing a novel bound on the difference between the expected return achieved by two policies in terms of the expected KL divergence (cross-entropy) of their induced distributions. To extend AGZ to generic sequential decision-making problems, we introduce a {\em robust MDP} framework, in which the agent and nature effectively play a zero-sum game: the agent aims to take actions to maximize reward while nature seeks state transitions, subject to the constraints of that environment, that minimize the agent's reward.

Estimation of skill distribution from a tournament,"Vivek Farias, Srikanth Jagabathula, Devavrat Shah",,,,,,"The central operational problem faced by managers is the prediction of revenues from various offer sets using the available historical sales data. Such revenue predictions form crucial inputs to assortment planning: deciding the “optimal” offer set with respect to a given objective (eg revenue) subject to various constraints (eg limited display or shelf space). Clearly, the offer set significantly impacts the choices made by the customers and, hence, the revenues and the margins seen by the seller. Therefore, it is the key decision problem, for instance, faced by retailers and has several variants depending on the desired objective and the imposed constraints. In all these variants, the key building block towards making such decisions is the procedure that estimates the revenue for a given offer set based on the historical sales data. Estimation of the revenues of a given offer set primarily requires two components:(1) prices of the products in the offer set and (2) the chance that a given product in the offer set is purchased by an incoming customer when the offer set is on display. Given prices of products, the revenue estimation boils down to predicting the share (fraction of sales) of each product in the offer set. This is challenging because of substitution behavior, where customers substitute an unavailable product with an available one. This makes the share observed for a product a combination of the primary demand for the product and the additional demand observed due to substitution. Clearly, capturing these substitution effects effectively is crucial to producing accurate revenue estimates.

Revisiting stochastic loss networks: Structures and approximations,"Holly A Waisanen, Devavrat Shah, Munther A Dahleh",,,,,,"Previous research in the tradeoff between throughput and delay in wireless networks has focused on networks with fixed nodes or nodes with random mobility. In this paper, motivated to study fundamental limits of delay in a wireless network with maximal throughput, we examine delay scaling in networks in which the mobile nodes may control their own motion and schedule the pickup and delivery of messages so as to achieve maximal throughput while minimizing delay. We find that by letting nodes control their mobility, even with very minimal information, results in significant delay reduction.",0,"Control Reduces Delay in Mobile Wireless Networks with Maximal Throughput

Interactions between learning and broadcasting in wireless recommendation systems,"Devavrat Shah, Pankaj Gupta",,,,,,"FOR TCAM S special type of fully associative memory: a ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM). Each cell in a TCAM can take three logic states: 0, 1, or don’t-care X. A CAM allows a fully parallel search of the forwarding table or a classifier database. The ternary capability lets the TCAM store wild cards and variable-length prefixes by storing don’t-cares. Lookups are performed in a TCAM by storing forwarding table entries in order of decreasing prefix lengths and choosing the first entry among all the entries that match the incoming packet’s destination address. Packet classification is carried out similarly by storing classifier rules in order of decreasing priority. The need to maintain a sorted list makes incremental updates slow in a TCAM. If N is the total number of prefixes to be stored in a TCAM having M entries, naive addition of a new entry can result in the need to moveO (N) TCAM entries to create the space …",0,"Fast Updating Algorithms

Approximately Reversible Stochastic Processing Networks,"Lara Dolecek, Devavrat Shah",,,,,,"We address the question of understanding the effect of underlying graphical structure and opinion propagation on creating influence of individuals in a social network. As an important contribution of this paper, we propose a natural model for information propagation in a social network based on the classical information-theoretic (broadcasting) model. Under this model, an opinion originating at an agent is transmitted to its neighbors, and subsequently to their other neighbors in a recursive manner. The opinion may be sent intact or altered, depending upon the agent’s own disagreement with the received opinion, where the amount of disagreement is given by the probability of alteration. In this setting, an agent is influential if other agents reasonably far away collectively agree with the original opinion.
The main result of this paper is a crisp characterization of the existence of an influential agent in terms of the …",0,"Influence in a Society: Interplay Between Information Dynamics and Network Structure

Application of Fusion Technique and Support Vector Machine for Identifying Specific Vegetation Type,"Kyomin Jung, Devavrat Shah, Jinwoo Shin",,,,,,"We consider design of fast and robust iterative algorithm for distributed linear computation based on classical linear update method. The design of such an algorithm involves finding transition matrix P of a Markov chain on network graph G with fast mixing time and small size (number of non-zero entries in P). We present a novel method, which we call pseudo-lifting to construct such a desirable P starting from a given matrix Q (say, that obtained by Metropolis-Hastings rule). Under thus constructed P, the total distributed operations for linear computation is O ((| E|+ Dn) D), where D is the diameter of G, and n is the number of nodes. This construction works for any graph and does not utilize any structural graph properties. Next, we present a hierarchical construction that cleverly utilizes the geometry of the graph to obtain P with much smaller computation cost. Specifically, for graphs with doubling dimension ρ, it takes O",0,"Lifted Markov Chains for Fast Linear Computation

Asynchronous approximation of a single component of the solution to a linear system,"Abbas El Gamal, James Mammen, Balaji Prabhakar, Devavrat Shah",,,,,,"Gupta and Kumar (2000) introduced a random network model to study how throughput scales in a fixed wireless network when nodes are fixed, and showed that when n distinct source-destination pairs are chosen at random the throughput per sourcedestination pair is Θ (1/√ n log n). Grossglauser and Tse (2001) showed that in the presence of mobility throughput per sourcedestination pair increases all the way to Θ (1). In this paper, we study the throughput region of fixed random networks, that is the set of all possible achievable rate-tuple λ=(λij) 1≤ i, j≤ n, where λij is the rate at which node i sends data to node j. We show that λ is achievable as long as net rate at which data sent from any node and net rate at which data is received at any node is O (1/√ n log n), that is∑ k λik and∑ k λki are O (1/√ n log n) for all i.

On robustness of principal component regression,"Srikanth Jagabathula, Devavrat Shah",,,,,,"We consider the problem of designing a fair schedul-ing algorithm for discrete-time constrained queuing networks. Each queue has dedicated exogenous packet arrivals. There are constraints on which queues can be served simultaneously. This model effectively describes important special instances like network switches, interference in wireless networks, bandwidth sharing for congestion control and traffic scheduling in road roundabouts. Fair scheduling is required because it provides isolation to different traffic flows; isolation makes the system more robust and enables providing quality of service. Existing work on fairness for constrained networks concentrates on flow based fairness. As a main result, we describe a notion of packet based fairness by establishing an analogy with the ranked election problem: packets are voters, schedules are candidates and each packet ranks the schedules based on its priorities …",0,"Fair Scheduling in Constrained Networks Through Ranked Elections

Learning RUMs: Reducing Mixture to Single Component via PCA,"Gagan Aggarwal, Rajeev Motwani, Devavrat Shah, An Zhu",,,,,,"The essence of an Internet router is an n ข n switch which routes packets from input to output ports. Such a switch can be viewed as a bipartite graph with the input and output ports as the two vertex sets. Packets arriving at input port i and destined for output port j can be modeled as an edge from i to j. Current switch scheduling algorithms view the routing of packets at each time step as a selection of a bipartite matching. We take the view that the switch scheduling problem across a sequence of time-steps is an instance of the edge coloring problem for a bipartite multigraph. Implementation considerations lead us to seek edge coloring algorithms for bipartite multigraphs that are fast, decentralized, and online. We present a randomized algorithm which has the desired properties, and uses only a near-optimal∆ ท o ด∆ ต colors on dense bipartite graphs arising in the context of switch scheduling. This algorithm extends to nonbipartite graphs as well. It leads to a novel switch scheduling algorithm which, for stochastic online edge arrivals, is stable, ie, the queue length at each input port is bounded at all times. We note that this is the first decentralized switch scheduling algorithm that is also guaranteed to be stable.",0,"Switch Scheduling via Randomized Edge Coloring ฃ
