In order to ease the process of circuit design, these tradeoffs are being analyzed using multi-objective optimization methodologies. This paper presents a hybrid multi-objective optimization framework (MHPSO), a combination of particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing. The framework emphasizes on preserving nondominated solutions in an external archive. The multi-dimensional space excluding the archive is divided into several sub-spaces according to a velocity-temperature mapping scheme. Further, the solutions in each sub-space are optimized using simulated annealing for generation of a Pareto front. The framework is extended by incorporating crowding distance comparison operator (MHPSO-CD) to maintain nondominated solutions in the archive.

Fast Power Density Aware 3D-IC Floorplanning for Hard Macro-Blocks Using Best Operator Combination Genetic Algorithm,"Naorem Yaipharenba Meitei, Krishna Baishnab, Gaurav Trivedi",2023/3/6,,,,,"In this article, we propose a fast 3D-IC floorplanning method for hard macro-blocks that includes a thermal management scheme. It applies a genetic algorithm constituted by an optimal combination of crossover and mutation operations to identify the optimal solution for design variables, namely, total wire length, number of through-silicon vias (TSVs), and maximum average layer power density. The proposed method additionally makes use of a unique TSV placement scheme that arranges TSVs next to their respective functional blocks. To enable efficient heat transmission to the ambient environment, layers with higher power densities are placed closer to the heat sink. The proposed 3D-IC floorplanning approach provides the fewest TSVs, the lowest peak temperature, and promising values of wire length within the least amount of computation time. Compared to the recent fast thermal analysis for fixed-outline 3D-floorplanning, it generates 13.14% shorter wire length, 39.27% lower peak temperature, and 34.35% lesser number of TSVs on average with significant improvement in computation time, while analyzing GSRC thermal benchmark circuits.",0,"Fast Power Density Aware 3D-IC Floorplanning for Hard Macro-Blocks Using Best Operator Combination Genetic Algorithm

PowerPlanningDL: Reliability-aware framework for on-chip power grid design using deep learning,"Sukanta Dey, Sukumar Nandi, Gaurav Trivedi",2020/3/9,,,,IEEE,"With the increase in the complexity of chip designs, VLSI physical design has become a time-consuming task, which is an iterative design process. Power planning is that part of the floorplanning in VLSI physical design where power grid networks are designed in order to provide adequate power to all the underlying functional blocks. Power planning also requires multiple iterative steps to create the power grid network while satisfying the allowed worst-case IR drop and Electromigration (EM) margin. For the first time, this paper introduces Deep learning (DL)-based framework to approximately predict the initial design of the power grid network, considering different reliability constraints. The proposed framework reduces many iterative design steps and speeds up the total design cycle. Neural Network-based multi-target regression technique is used to create the DL model.

As the number of functional blocks is increasing in an SoC chronologically, the need of the hour is to have more power lines in order to provide adequate power connections to the extra-added functional blocks. Therefore, to accommodate more functional blocks in the minimum area possible, the PGN should also have minimum area. Minimization of the area can be achieved by relaxing few power grid constraints. In view of this, due to the resistance of the PGN, it suffers from considerable reliability issues such as voltage drop noise and electromigration. Further, it also suffers from the interconnect delay and power dissipation due to its parasitic resistances and capacitances.

Based on the combinations of and , an -bit ESA has possible configurations. In this paper, we analyse ESAs and propose analytical models to estimate accuracy, delay, power and area of ESAs. The key features of the proposed analytical models are that: (i) They are generalized, i.e., work for all possible configurations of an -bit ESA; and (ii) They are superior (i.e., estimate more accurately …",17,"Analysis, modeling and optimization of equal segment based approximate adders

In this study, the authors propose analytical models to estimate Pass Rate (PR), delay, power and area of ESAs, where PR represents the probability of output to be correct. From the proposed analytical models, they observe that there is a scope and need for improvement in quality‐effort curves of existing ESAs. Intended to improve the quality‐effort curves, they propose modifications in existing ESAs with design objective that modified ESAs provide higher accuracy without imposing any additional delay, power and area overheads. Both the authors’ analytical and simulation results show that modified ESAs provide higher accuracy, better quality‐effort curves and more optimal Delay–Power–Area …",3,"Accuracy enhancement of equal segment based approximate adders

Our method first clusters a netlist to reduce the number of cells and then performs quadratic optimization on the reduced netlist. Finally, it uses Nesterov’s method for solving nonlinear equations for the problem. The framework of our tool, Kapees3, is scalable and generates high quality results. The experimental results for Peko Suite 1 and Peko Suite 2 benchmarks show promising improvements. Our placement tool outperforms NTUPlace3, Dragon, Feng Shui, Capo10.5, by 46%, 57%, 48% and 25%, respectively, on PEKO Suite 1. For PEKO Suite 2, our placement tool outperforms NTUPlace3, Dragon, Feng Shui, Capo10.5 and mPL6 by 30%, 47%, 57%, 69% and 2.7%, respectively.

A High Frequency MOS-based Floating Charge-Controlled Memcapacitor Emulator,"Sukanta Dey, Satyabrata Dash, Sukumar Nandi, Gaurav Trivedi",2018/7/8,,,,IEEE,"Due to the resistance of metal wires in power grid network, voltage drop noise occurs in the form of IR drop which may change the output logic of underlying circuits and may affect the reliability performance of a chip. Further, it is necessary to handle different reliability constraints while designing a robust power grid network for a chip. Any violation of such constraints may increase the occurrences of IR drop. Therefore, there is a need to minimize the IR drop without violating the reliability constraints. In this paper, the IR drop minimization problem is formulated as a single objective large-scale variable minimization problem subjected to different reliability constraints, such as IR drop constraints, electromigration constraints, minimum width constraints, metal area constraints. At first, the large-scale minimization problem is divided into several subproblems using a divide and conquer based decomposition strategy, called …",10,"PGIREM: reliability-constrained IR drop minimization and electromigration assessment of VLSI power grid networks using cooperative coevolution

The role of a voltage trigger pulse having variable rise time when applied to the base terminal is investigated to model the underlying physics of the anomalous switching behavior. Experimental observations related to ultrafast anomalous switching mechanisms of trigger transistor, i.e., either primary breakdown or current mode secondary breakdown, for faster and slower base drives are presented. This demonstrates the importance of the dynamic avalanche process and reverse saturation current on the switching mechanism under high-speed base-trigger ramps for different avalanche BJTs from various manufacturers and different lots.
