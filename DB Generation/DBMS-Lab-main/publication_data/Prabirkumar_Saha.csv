Hybrid technique for removal of arsenic from drinking water,"Soumi Sarkar, Soumendu Hazra, Kaushik Chakraborty, Ananya Nayak, Prabirkumar Saha",2023/2,Chemical Engineering & Technology,46.0,2.0,,Amalgamation of a supported liquid membrane (SLM) and electrocoagulation are carried out to remove As(III) and As(V) from drinking water to achieve a high treatment efficiency. The process is based on uphill transport of arsenic ions against their concentration gradients across phases and has the advantage of simultaneous extraction and recovery followed by electrocoagulation of arsenic. The aim of the process is selective separation of arsenic from drinking water and to reduce its concentration below 10 ppb. An iron‐arsenic precipitate is obtained by using an iron anode and the said precipitate is a value‐added saleable product. Various adsorption isotherms are evaluated to understand the removal mechanism of arsenic by the formation of iron‐arsenic precipitates. The Freundlich isotherm and Dubinin‐Radushkevich model are found to fit well with the adsorption data of the removal of arsenic ions.,0,"Hybrid technique for removal of arsenic from drinking water

Design of fractional-order IMC for nonlinear chemical processes with time delay,"Gorakala Saikumar, Kapil Kumar Sahu, Prabirkumar Saha",2022/12/27,International Journal of Dynamics and Control,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"The motivation of this work is to explore the merits of fractional calculus for designing IMC that uses higher fractional-order filter and controls processes with significant time delays. It is an established fact that fractional-order filter gives extra tuning parameter for controller design, and Smith predictor is an efficient tool for handling time delays. However, the combinatorial performance of fractional-order and Smith-compensated IMC, especially in case of second-order system with significant process-model mismatch and measurement noise, is the focus of this manuscript. Their performance has been assessed and compared with an optimum PID controller available in the literature designed for similar cases. Simulation has been carried out in three case studies involving a linear transfer function model, a nonlinear CSTR process and a cryogenic distillation process. A comparative analysis of all the controllers has been …",0,"Design of fractional-order IMC for nonlinear chemical processes with time delay

Kinetics of growth and multi substrate degradation by an indigenous mixed microbial culture isolated from a wastewater...,"Pichiah Saravanan, Prabirkumar Saha",,,,,,"An indigenous mixed culture of microorganisms, isolated from a sewage treatment plant, was investigated for its potential to simultaneously degrade phenol and m-cresol during its growth in batch shake flasks. 22 full factorial designs with the two substrates as the factors, at two different levels and two different initial concentration ranges, were employed to carry out the biodegradation experiments. For complete utilisation of phenol and m-cresol, the culture took a minimum duration of 21 hrs at their low concentration of 100 mg/L each, and a maximum duration of 187hrs at high concentration of 600mg/L each in the multisubstrate system. The biodegradation results also showed that the presence of phenol in low concentration range (100–300mg/L did not inhibit m-cresol biodegradation; on the other hand, presence of m-cresol inhibited phenol biodegradation by the culture. Moreover, irrespective of the concentrations used, phenol was degraded preferentially and earlier than m-cresol. During the culture growth, a lag phase was observed above a combined concentration of 500 mg/L ie, 200 mg/L m-cresol and 300 mg/L of phenol and above). Statistical analysis of the specific growth rate of the culture in the multisubstrate system was also performed in the form of ANOVA and Student ‘t’test, which gave good interpretation in terms of main and interaction effects of the substrates.",0,"Kinetics of growth and multi substrate degradation by an indigenous mixed microbial culture isolated from a wastewater...

Catechin aids great pharmacological benefits to human health such as reduction of cholesterol and hypertension, anti-oxidation, anti-microbial, protection against cardiovascular disease and cancer. Catechin is found in leaves and flowers of tea plants (Camellia sinensis). Liquid membrane based separation technique is an extraction/recovery process of solute from solute rich source phase to solvent phase and thereby from solvent phase to strip phase. Vegetable oils such as coconut oil, soyabean oil, sunflower oil and mustard oil are known to be both environmentally as well as physiologically benign solvents. The efficacy of these vegetable oils for extraction of bioactive component has been explored in this work. Various vegetables oils and carriers viz. aliquat 336, trioctylamine (TOA), di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid, nn-dimethyloctylamine and tributyl phosphate (TBP) have been tried.

Practically no solute transfer occurs with mustard oil as a solvent, whereas sunflower and soybean oil yields low transfer rate (18% and 19.5% respectively). Nevertheless, coconut oil has been found to be an ideal green solvent for this purpose which yields an extraction efficiency of 84% with Shalimar® coconut oil (Shalimar Chemical Works Limited) even without using any transport enhancing carrier agent. The performance is further enhanced with a different brand of coconut oil, viz. Parachute®(Marico International), which yields 92% extraction. The performance of liquid membrane depends upon various operating conditions such as feed concentration, pH, stirring speed, carrier concentrations, temperature and various other physical and chemical condition of the process.

SEPARATION OF Cd (II) FROM ITS AQUEOUS SOLUTION USING LIQUID MEMBRANE,"Kamal Kumar Bhatluri, Mriganka Sekhar Manna, Prabirkumar Saha, Aloke Kumar Ghoshal",,,,,,"Environmental pollution due to heavy metals (Cd, Hg, Pb, As, Ni and Cr etc.) from the industrial wastewater has been a long standing problem. Heavy metals that cause severe damage to human health are not biodegradable and hence it is important that they should be removed before effluent disposal. The major sources of effluent containing heavy metals are industries viz. Chloro-alkali, pulp & paper, battery, fertilizer, mining & combustion and rubber processing. Separation of heavy metals by liquid membrane (LM) is one of the most promising separation technologies. The LM is a homogeneous, thin film of liquid (membrane phase) interposed between two other liquid phases, viz. feed (or source) phase and receiving (or strip) phase. The transport of solute across the LM occurs due to its higher solubility and diffusivity in the liquid film as well as the concentration gradients in the phases. In LM based separation the primary issue is selection of suitable solvent (for membrane phase). Most of the conventional organic solvents widely used for the heavy metals extraction processes are toxic, flammable and volatile in nature. So, heavy metals from the industrial effluent need to be separated by green technology. The performance of LM based separation process is affected by various physical and chemical parameters viz. pH, concentration, stirring rate of the aqueous phases, temperature and carrier concentration. In the present work, three phase studies were carried out for extraction and recovery of Cd (II) through the bulk liquid membrane (BLM) configuration.

Separation of Lignosulfonate from Aqueous Solution Using Liquid Membrane,"Kabita Chakrabarty, K Vamsy Krishna, Prabirkumar Saha, Aloke Kumar Ghoshal",,,,,,"The pulp and paper industry consumes a large volume of water and subsequently discharges enormous amount of effluent containing organic and inorganic pollutants such as lignosulfonate, sucrose, polyose, cooking chemicals and silica [1]. Lignosulfonate is a polydispersed polyelectrolyte that has a spherical macromolecular structure [2]. Extensive uses of commercial grade lignosulfonate include production of vanillin, animal feed pellet binders, dispersant for dye, pesticides, carbon black etc. It has applications in water treatment and industrial cleaning operations too. Attempts to utilize the paper mill waste stream as a source of lignosulfonate requires an efficient separation technology which will ensure effective separation on one hand and clear reusable water on the other.
Howard process is a well known industrial unit for separation of lignosulphonate from aqueous solution however it uses huge quantity of lime for the separation. Several other methods exist such as ultra filtration, ion-exchange, dialysis, electro dialysis and extraction with amines. Nevertheless, they are still in their lab-scale operation stage and are yet to be economically viable for industrial applications.
