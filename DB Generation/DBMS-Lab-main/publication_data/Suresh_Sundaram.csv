Modified sparse representation classification framework for online writer identification,"Vivek Venugopal, Suresh Sundaram",2021,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",51.0,1.0,IEEE,"In this paper, we propose a modified strategy using sparse representation to identify the authorship of online handwritten documents. The note-worthy aspect of this paper lies in the introduction of a-priori information for each dictionary atom, that in a way indicates its degree of importance with respect to the dynamic characteristics of the writer. The methodology behind obtaining this information for the dictionary atoms is based on the computation of entropy values over histograms that are generated from the sparse coefficients during the training phase. The prelearned values are incorporated on the traditional schemes of “max” and “mean” pooling of sparse codes, thereby resulting in a modified writer descriptor. Experiments performed with the proposed sparse classification strategy on the handwritten samples of the IAM and IBM-UB1 online handwriting databases demonstrate promising results.",12,"Modified sparse representation classification framework for online writer identification

Online Signature Verification using Time Warp Edit Distance based kernel,"Sarojit Auddya, Rajat Kumar Singh, Suresh Sundaram",2020/9/8,,,,IEEE,"In this paper, we propose a new method for dynamic signature verification. We adapt a metric known as Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED) for computing the similarity score between two online traces of signature data samples. We derive a set of secondary features from the online trace of a user's signature and further propose to employ a sequence of Autoregressive coefficients. The TWED algorithm is applied on the set of features obtained from the online traces of signatures. In our approach, we use Support Vector Machine for classification of the samples as either genuine or forgery. We formulate a new kernel function based on the TWED metric in the SVM framework for verification. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm, we perform a set of experiments on the publicly available MCYT-100 database. We present improvements over several state of art works.",1,"Online Signature Verification using Time Warp Edit Distance based kernel

A Deep Learning Framework with Histogram Features for Online Writer Identification,"Sounak Ray, Addrish Roy, Suresh Sundaram",2020/9/8,,,,IEEE,"This paper proposes a technique to identify the authorship of an online handwritten text using descriptors inspired by the Pattern of Local Gravitational Force (PLGF) from the area of computer vision. The strategy strives to leverage the spatial and temporal information in an online handwritten trace. A noteworthy aspect is that the spatial descriptors are based on histograms that are generated by incorporating the pressure and velocity information encapsulated in the sub-strokes of a writer. Thereafter, we utilize sequence modelling techniques to capture the temporal information present in the sequence of descriptors obtained from consecutive sub-strokes. By considering a sub-stroke as a basic temporal unit of a writer's trace, we propose a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder to compress the sequence data. The compressed representation is then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to obtain the …",1,"A Deep Learning Framework with Histogram Features for Online Writer Identification

Online writer identification system using adaptive sparse representation framework,"Vivek Venugopal, Suresh Sundaram",2020/5,IET Biometrics,9.0,3.0,The Institution of Engineering and Technology,"This study explores an adaptive sparse representation approach for online writer identification. The main focus is on employing prior information that quantifies the degree of importance of a dictionary atom concerning a given writer. This information is proposed by a fusion of two derived components. The first component is a saliency measure obtained from the sum‐pooled sparse coefficients corresponding to the sub‐strokes of a set of enrolled writers. The second component is a similarity score, computed for each dictionary atom with regards to a given writer, that is related to the reconstruction error of the sub‐stroke based feature vectors. The proposed identification is accomplished with an ensemble of support vector machines (SVMs), wherein the input to the SVM trained for a writer is obtained by incorporating the adapted saliency values of that writer on the document descriptor obtained via average pooling of …",4,"Online writer identification system using adaptive sparse representation framework

Exploration of CNN features for online handwriting recognition,"Subhasis Mandal, SR M Prasanna, Suresh Sundaram",2019/9/20,,,,IEEE,"Recently, convolution neural network (CNN) has demonstrated its powerful ability in learning features particularly from image data. In this work, its capability of feature learning in online handwriting is explored, by constructing various CNN architectures. The developed CNNs can process online handwriting directly unlike the existing works that convert the online handwriting to an image to utilize the architecture. The first convolution layer accepts the sequence of (x; y) coordinates along the trace of the character as an input and outputs a convolved filtered signal. Thereafter, via alternating steps of convolution and Rectified Linear Unit layers, in a hierarchical fashion, we obtain a set of deep features that can be employed for classification.

Online writer identification using GMM based feature representation and writer-specific weights,"Vivek Venugopal, Suresh Sundaram",2019/9/20,,,,IEEE,"This paper focuses on a method to ascertain the identity of an online handwritten document. The proposed methodology makes use of a set of descriptors that are derived from features obtained in a probabilistic sense. In this regard, we employ a GMM-based feature representation where in each point-based feature vector in the online trace is represented by a vector. Each element of the aforementioned vector quantify the membership to a particular Gaussian in the GMM. A differing aspect is in the proposal of a weighting scheme that measures the influence of each Gaussian of a writer in the probabilistic space. For deriving these weights, we rely on the information obtained from a histogram, by formulating a function of the sum-pooled posterior probabilities obtained across all the enrolled documents in the database. The identification is performed by an ensemble of SVMs where each SVM is modelled for a given …",1,"Online writer identification using GMM based feature representation and writer-specific weights

An improved discriminative region selection methodology for online handwriting recognition,"Subhasis Mandal, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Suresh Sundaram",2019/3/7,International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR),22.0,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"The task of online handwriting recognition (HR) becomes often challenging due to the presence of confusing characters which are separable by a small region. To address this problem, we propose a “discriminative region (DR) selection” technique which highlights the discriminative region that distinguishes one character from another similar character. The existing DR selection approach for online handwriting often finds spurious DR when the intra-class shape variations become higher than the distinction between DRs of the two characters. The proposed technique which is an improved version of the existing approach can minimize the effect of high intra-class variations and results in robust DR selection. In addition, we propose an online HR system enabling DR-based processing in a single-stage classification framework. The use of hidden Markov model and support vector machine classifiers is …",5,"An improved discriminative region selection methodology for online handwriting recognition

Novel approaches for basic unit modeling in online handwriting recognition ﻿,Subhashish Mandal,2019,,,,,"An unconstrained, writer-independent, large vocabulary online handwritten word recognition system can be developed by modeling the basic recognition unit of the script. The basic recognition unit or the basic unit for brevity, represents the set of patterns (characters/strokes) for which the handwriting models are created. This thesis focuses on developing novel methods for basic unit modeling in online handwriting recognition. Three different directions of work are presented in this thesis for basic unit modeling. In the first part, two novel strategies are proposed to improve the classification ability of an existing basic unit recognition system by performing a reevaluation of the decision of a classifier. The classifiers namely hidden Markov model (HMM) and Dynamic time warping (DTW) are considered for the same. The second part of the thesis presents two new feature representations for the basic units, mainly from a probabilistic viewpoint. In the first representation, the probabilistic features are derived from a set of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) which are learned on the existing feature space. On the other hand, the second feature representation is extracted directly from the trace of online handwriting by adopting a convolution neural network (CNN). The third part of the thesis explores the hybrid deep neural network – hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) framework to model the basic units. Finally, all the different explorations made in the thesis are combined and the integrated system is evaluated on online handwritten word samples. The experiments are performed on databases of two scripts namely Assamese and English. We empirically show …",1,"Novel approaches for basic unit modeling in online handwriting recognition

Exploration of novel descriptors for online writer identication,Vivek Venugopal,2019,,,,,"The problem of writer identification refers to the task of deciding on the authorship of a piece of handwritten document by comparing it against a set of samples saved in a database. Technology has aided in the design of hand held devices like tablets that can capture a person's handwriting. The main constituent of these devices is an electronic pen/stylus that helps in obtaining the dynamic information in handwriting through its tip. Online writer identification systems make use of such textual content for deriving the identity of the writer.The present thesis focuses on proposing novel descriptors for a text-independent online writer identification system. In the first part of our work, we represent the spatio-temporal trace from a document with descriptors derived from a codebook.

Exploring Discriminative HMM States for Improved Recognition of Online Handwriting,"Subhasis Mandal, Himakshi Choudhury, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Suresh Sundaram",2018/8/20,,,,IEEE,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for online handwriting recognition (HR) based on hidden Markov model (HMM). In a conventional HMM-based HR system, the input test sample is recognized by first measuring the log-likelihood score from each class-specific HMM, and then the class with the highest score is assigned as the recognized class. It is observed that, for a given test sample, the difference in log-likelihood scores of top-2 outputs (classes) is often less for faithful classification. The problem intensifies for those scripts that have a large set of similar shape characters such as the Indic script. To address this problem, first, we analyze the HMM states corresponding to the top-2 classes and identify a subset of states that most discriminate the two classes. Afterwards, the final recognition among the two classes is carried out by comparing the log-likelihood scores of these chosen states.

Exploring sparse representation for improved online handwriting recognition,"Subhasis Mandal, Syed Shahnawazuddin, Rohit Sinha, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Suresh Sundaram",2018/8/5,,,,IEEE,"This work studies the sparse representation based classification (SRC) framework for online handwriting recognition (HR) task. In this framework, first, an exemplar dictionary is created using the training samples from each of the classes in the chosen task. Subsequently, the test samples are sparse coded over exemplar dictionary for classification. In sparse coding, both l_0 - and l_1 -norm based greedy algorithms are studied. Further, for reducing the computational cost of the SRC-based HR approach, the learned exemplar dictionary has also been explored. The proposed SRC-based approach is demonstrated for character and limited vocabulary word recognition task and evaluated on three different corpora: the Assamese digit database, the UNIPEN English character database and the UNIPEN ICROW-03 English word database.

Dnn-hmm based large vocabulary online handwritten assamese word recognition system,"Subhasis Mandal, Himakshi Choudhury, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Suresh Sundaram",2018/8/5,,,,IEEE,"In this work, we consider recognizing online handwritten Assamese word (an Indic script) using the hybrid deep neural network - hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) framework. The recognition task is generally challenging since Assamese handwriting is mixed with the discrete and cursive writing style, and further complicated due to the placing of vowel/consonant modifier above and/or below already written character in delayed order. Also, as it contains large character set, there is lack of common definition of the basic unit (BU) for automatic recognition. As a step in this direction, first, we select 173 BU capable of characterizing 20K most frequent Assamese words. The HMMs are created for these selected BUs. Next, we create a lexicon for word recognition where each word is represented by all probable ""sequence of BUs"" that constitute the word.

Histogram-based matching of GMM encoded features for online signature verification,"Abhishek Sharma, Suresh Sundaram",2018/8/5,,,,IEEE,"This paper explores a scheme for verifying the authenticity of online signatures. We make contributions with regards to (i) the encoding of features used and (ii) the matching strategy. Most works in the literature that consider comparing the temporal sequence between two signatures utilize the local features derived at each sample point of the online trace. One aspect worth investigating is on representing these features in a probabilistic framework. In this work, we use the parameters from a pre-learnt Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to encode the features. Secondly, with regards to matching strategy, we consider comparing a histogram between a test signature with those obtained from the enrolled signatures of a user. The histogram is generated from the GMM encoded features by partitioning the online trace of the signature into a number of segments.

A hierarchical codebook descriptor approach for online writer identification,"Vivek Venugopal, Surbhi Pillai, Suresh Sundaram",2018/8/5,,,,IEEE,"This work proposes a technique to identify the authorship of an online handwritten document. The strategy focuses on encoding a set of feature vectors obtained from sample points of the online trace with a descriptor, by employing a pair of codebooks. The derived descriptors correspond to scoring each attribute of the feature vector on the basis of their proximity to the respective values of the assigned codevectors. The two codebooks consist of codevectors pre-learnt by a two level k-means clustering applied on the feature vectors derived from a subset of writers. The descriptors are constructed from features that are specified using a 'gap parameter', that capture the neighborhood information of the trace.

Neuroscience inspired segmentation of handwritten words,"AG Ramakrishnan, Suresh Sundaram",,,,,,"The challenge of segmenting online handwritten Tamil words has hardly been investigated. In this paper, we report a neuroscience-inspired, lexicon-free approach to segment Tamil words into its constituent symbols (recognizable entities). Based on a simple dominant overlap criterion, the word is grossly segmented into candidate symbols (stroke groups). However, this segmentation is not fully reliable because of varying writing styles resulting in varying levels of overlap. Taking cues from vertebrate visual perception, we utilize both feature based attention and feedback from the classifier to detect possible wrong segmentations. This attention-feedback segmentation (AFS) strategy splits or merges the stroke groups to correct the segmentation errors and forms valid symbols. This maiden attempt on segmentation is tested on 10000 handwritten words collected from hundreds of writers. The efficacy of AFS in segmentation and improving the recognition performance of the handwriting system is amply demonstrated. Our results show a segmentation accuracy of over 99% at symbol level.",0,"Neuroscience inspired segmentation of handwritten words
