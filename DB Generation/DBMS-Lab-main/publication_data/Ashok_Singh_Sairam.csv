A multi-objective worker selection scheme in crowdsourced platforms using NSGA-II,"Akash Yadav, Sumit Mishra, Ashok Singh Sairam",2022/9/1,Expert Systems with Applications,201.0,,Pergamon,"Crowdsourcing has led to a paradigm shift in how commercial houses execute projects by lowering the production cost. A crucial aspect of crowdsourcing is selecting the best set of workers to perform a task. The environment envisaged in this work is an independent pool of workers, each equipped with a pre-defined set of skills. We assume that these skills do not follow any priority order over each other. Given a task with a set of required skills, we aim to select a team of workers who can collectively fulfil the task’s requirements, while maximizing the collective expertise and minimizing the team cost. We propose a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) based algorithm to find the best set of workers that can perform the task. The basic operators of the evolutionary computation approach are tuned in accordance with our problem objectives. We perform a detailed analysis to show that the solution is well …",6,"A multi-objective worker selection scheme in crowdsourced platforms using NSGA-II

Ripple: An approach to locate k nearest neighbours for location-based services,"Pratima Biswas, Sourav Kumar Dandapat, Ashok Singh Sairam",2022/3/1,,105.0,,Pergamon,"The increasing popularity of location-based services has led to a renewed interest in spatial query processing. In this paper, we propose Ripple, a light-weighted framework to find the nearest neighbours. The area is divided into square cells of equal size to form a grid structure. The search advances by progressively expanding the investigation region as a series of concentric squares, with the cell of query point as the centre. This is in contrast to the popular approach of increasing the search space as concentric circles. The circular search scheme explores only those square cells that intersect the circle and as a result, has a smaller search region. However, it has an added overhead of tracing the cells that intersect the circle for the same reason. In Ripple, there is no such additional overhead due to harmony in the investigation region’s configuration and the underlying grid structure. We optimize the search space by …",2,"Ripple: An approach to locate k nearest neighbours for location-based services

Controller placement problem in software‐defined networking: A survey,"Abha Kumari, Ashok Singh Sairam",2021/9,Networks,78.0,2.0,"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","A distinctive feature of software‐defined networking (SDN) is a logically centralized control plane realized using multiple physical controllers. The placement of the controllers, the so‐called controller placement problem (CPP), is a crucial design issue. It influences network performance parameters such as latency, flow setup time, network availability, load balance of the controllers, and energy consumption. In this article, we illustrate the formulation of these CPP objectives. We categorize the CPP design solutions as either static or adaptive. In adaptive CPP, the solutions proposed dynamically adapt to the number of controllers required and the switch to controller mapping to varying network traffic. We further differentiate adaptive CPP as wired or wireless. The optimization strategies adopted by the papers are analyzed and grouped into five categories: exact, heuristic, meta‐heuristic, clustering, and game theory …",12,"Controller placement problem in software‐defined networking: A survey

A Budget and Deadline Aware Task Assignment Scheme for Crowdsourcing Environment,"Akash Yadav, Joydeep Chandra, Ashok Singh Sairam",2021/3/3,IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing,10.0,2.0,IEEE,"This article addresses the problem of assigning heterogeneous tasks with multiple skill requirements in crowdsourcing platforms. The aim is to find mutually exclusive, a highly-productive set of workers who can successfully complete the tasks within a given deadline and budget. We propose a timeline based weighted aggregation (TWA) technique to quantify the per-skill score of a worker. The score is computed based on the worker’s profile and past work experiences. Given the worker’s score, we formulate the problem as one of maximizing the productivity of all the given tasks. A two-stage approximation solution is proposed. In the first stage, we offer a greedy-based 2-approximation algorithm for a single task. In the second stage, a local ratio based algorithm is proposed to extend the solution for multiple tasks. The overall solution is shown to be 3-approximate. Finally, simulation results using real-world data …",3,"A Budget and Deadline Aware Task Assignment Scheme for Crowdsourcing Environment

An analytical model for information gathering and propagation in social networks using random graphs,"Samant Saurabh, Sanjay Madria, Anirban Mondal, Ashok Singh Sairam, Saurabh Mishra",2020/9/1,Data & Knowledge Engineering,129.0,,North-Holland,"In this paper, we propose an analytical model for information gathering and propagation in social networks using random sampling. We represent the social network using the Erdos–Renyi model of the random graph. When a given node is selected in the social network, information about itself and all of its neighbors are obtained and these nodes are considered to be discovered. We provide an analytical solution for the expected number of nodes that are discovered as a function of the number of nodes randomly sampled in the graph. We use the concepts of combinatorics, probability, and inclusion–exclusion principle for computing the number of discovered nodes. This is a computationally-intensive problem with combinatorial complexity. This model is useful when crawling and mining of the social network graph is prohibited. Our work finds application in several important real-world decision support scenarios …",5,"An analytical model for information gathering and propagation in social networks using random graphs

Worker selection in crowd-sourced platforms using non-dominated sorting,"Sumit Mishra, Akash Yadav, Ashok Singh Sairam",2019/10/17,,,,IEEE,"Crowdsourcing has lead to a paradigm shift in the manner commercial houses execute projects by lowering the cost-per-unit of production.

Predictive Flow Modeling in Software Defined Network,"Abha Kumari, Joydeep Chandra, Ashok Singh Sairam",2019/10/17,,,,IEEE,"The centralized control plane of Software Defined Network (SDN) introduces scalability concerns, which is addressed by physically distributing the control plane, although logically centralized. As the task of the control plane is delegated to multiple controllers, the layout of the controllers greatly influence the performance of the network. An important objective that researchers try to optimize while deciding placement of controllers is the flow setup time. This, in turn, depends on the number of flows generated. In this work, we decompose the network traffic into a time series model of flows. We use parametric and non-parametric learning techniques to predict the number of flows for the next epoch based on the current traffic dynamics. Two different real traffic traces have been used to develop the prediction models.",2,"Predictive Flow Modeling in Software Defined Network

Detecting semantic attacks in intelligent transport system,"Ashok Singh Sairam, Arav Garg",2019/9/5,,,,IEEE,"Intelligent Transport System (ITS) rely on cooperation between vehicles to create awareness of surroundings by an exchange of messages. The two standardized messages used in ITS communication are Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) and Decentralized Environment Notification Messages (DENM). A CAM is periodically transmitted by an ITS station to ensure awareness of the surrounding. DENMs are asynchronous messages triggered by events. In this work, we outline the possibility of a semantic attack on DENM messages. In a semantic attack, the messages generated by an ITS-station is manipulated to alter the meaning (semantic) to induce real damage to the transport system. Such attacks are hard to detect as the message syntax itself is legitimate. A dynamic trust model is proposed based on the messages generated by the ITS stations. Empirical results show that the model can discriminate …",1,"Detecting semantic attacks in intelligent transport system

A survey of controller placement problem in software defined networks,"Abha Kumari, Ashok Singh Sairam",2019/5/12,,,,,"Software Defined Network (SDN) is an emerging network paradigm which provides a centralized view of the network by decoupling the network control plane from the data plane. This strategy of maintaining a global view of the network optimizes resource management. However, the implementation of SDN using a single physical controller lead to issues of scalability and robustness. A physically distributed but logically centralized SDN controller architecture promises to resolve both these issues. Distributed SDN along with its benefits brings along the problem of the number of controllers required and their placement in the network. This problem is referred to as the controller placement problem (CPP) and this paper is mainly concerned with the CPP solution techniques. The paper formally defines CPP, gives a comprehensive review of the various performance metrics and characteristics of the available CPP solutions. Finally, we point out the existing literature gap and discuss the future research direction in this domain.",26,"A survey of controller placement problem in software defined networks

IP traceback in dynamic networks,"Sangita Roy, Hardik Chawla, Ashok Singh Sairam",2019/4/30,,939.0,,,"IP traceback or identifying an attacker is an important step for post analysis of denial of service (DoS) attacks. In this work, we present techniques to traceback in networks with dynamic topology. We consider network scenarios where edges/nodes may get added or deleted in the attack path during the process of traceback. Due to the alteration in the attack path, the standard traceback procedures proposed in literature fail to construct the attack path. An exact algorithm, based on the branch and bound technique is proposed which guarantees to completely determine the attack path. An approximation of this algorithm is also presented which is shown to have a less computational complexity but introduces false positives.",1,"IP traceback in dynamic networks

Modeling privacy approaches for location based services,"Pratima Biswas, Ashok Singh Sairam",2018/7/20,Computer Networks,140.0,,Elsevier,"Locationbased services (LBS) use geospatial data of mobile device to provide information in real time. A key concern in using these services is the need to reveal the user’s exact location, which may allow an adversary to infer private information about the user. To address the privacy concerns of LBS users, a number of security approaches have been proposed based on the concept of k-anonymity. The central idea in location k-anonymity is to find a set of k-1 users close to the actual user, such that the locations of these k users are indistinguishable from one another, thus protecting the identity of the user. A number of performance parameters like success rate, amount of privacy achieved are used to measure the performance of the k-anonymity approaches. However, there is no formal model to compare the different k-anonymity approaches. Moreover, these proposals also make the implicit, unrealistic assumption …",6,"Modeling privacy approaches for location based services

Inferring the deployment of source address validation filtering using silence of path-backscatter,"Samant Saurabh, Ashok Singh Sairam",2018/2/25,,,,IEEE,"IP source spoofing is a consequence of lack of packet level authentication in the Internet which allows attackers to carry out Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Source address validation filtering is one of the most important scheme that is deployed in the Internet to deter such attacks by filtering the spoofed IP packets. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to study the deployment of source address validation-filtering by using some special path backscatter messages that are generated by the spoofed traffic. We use the long term absence of such messages from an Autonomous System (AS) to classify it as non-spoofer AS. We use Caida's backscatter dataset for our study. We provide the list of spoofer and non-spoofer ASes from the given dataset. We also provide detailed mathematical analysis for calculating the amount of time we need to wait before declaring an AS as a …",1,"Inferring the deployment of source address validation filtering using silence of path-backscatter

Using bounded binary particle swarm optimization to analyze network attack graphs,"Ashok Singh Sairam, Sagar Kumar Verma",2018/1/4,,,,,"Binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is a technique widely used to solve combinatorial problems. In this paper, we propose a variant of BPSO to find most likely attack paths in an attack graph. The aim is to find an attack path with the highest attack probability and least path length. In such combinatorial optimization problem, the set of feasible solutions is usually discrete and an exhaustive search may lead to unnecessary examination of those segments of the search space, which are assured to not include a solution. The paper introduces the concept of bounding the solution space of BPSO. The minimum and maximum value of each objective called bound of the solution is computed. The search space of BPSO is restricted within these solution bounds and hence we name our approach as bounded binary particle swarm optimization (BBPSO). By bounding the solution space, those particles of BPSO which …",1,"Using bounded binary particle swarm optimization to analyze network attack graphs

Optimizing flow setup time in software defined network,"Abha Kumari, Joydeep Chandra, Ashok Singh Sairam",2018/1/3,,,,IEEE,"To address the issues of scalability in Software Defined Network (SDN), researchers have proposed a distributed control plane, where controllers are physically distributed but logically centralized. Network traffic is dynamic with respect to time and space, however, the key limitation of state-of-art work is that they make the unrealistic assumption that the traffic matrix is static. In this work, we assume that the network traffic is dynamic and to optimize the load on the SDN controller, we propose adaptive mapping between switches and the controller. The objective is to minimize the flow setup time as well as reduce the cost of reassignment.",4,"Optimizing flow setup time in software defined network

ExpertCrowd: An Expert Worker Assignment Framework for budget Constraint Tasks in Crowdsourcing Environment,"Akash Yadav, Joydeep Chandra, Ashok Singh Sairam",2018,Committee Members,,,,"Crowdsourcing has emerged as one of the vital domain in the pervasive computing where people-centric task and applications are deployed. Typically such tasks hire workers in an adhoc manner and provide them financial rewards. With the vast pool of available workers and diverse type of tasks, the major challenge in this area is the selection of expert workers from the crowd to perform a particular task while minimizing the cost expenditure. To solve this riddle, we proposed a scalable and efficient worker assignment framework. It first predicts the expertise of workers for a given task and then assigns the most efficient workers in mutually exclusive manner. In multitask scenario, this approach first predict the expertise of workers based on the semantic matching between the tasks requirements with the workers expertise. Then, it tries to allocate most efficient workers for each task under the given budget.

Managing Incoming Traffic,Ashok Singh Sairam,,,,,,"In the past few years, Internet access speeds of or-ganizations such as enterprises and educational institutions have improved significantly. However, increase in Internet speed do not necessarily translate into a proportionate increase in download performance if the traffic is not optimally distributed. In this work, we first identified that incoming traffic is the major source of congestion for network with high-content receivers. Secondly, we proposed a simple Load Balancing approach for multi-homed networks to improve Internet performance. A prototype of our scheme was implemented in an educational campus network. Finally, we propose to study our approach by scaling it to a domain network ie OSPF or IS-IS cloud, where the WAN links can be at different geographical location.",0,"Managing Incoming Traffic
