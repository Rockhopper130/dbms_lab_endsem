A Hand Gesture-operated System for Rehabilitation using an End-to-End Detection Framework,"H Pallab Jyoti Dutta, MK Bhuyan, Debanga Raj Neog, Karl F MacDorman, RH Laskar",2023/3/2,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,,,IEEE,"We propose a hand gesture-operated system as an AI application to relieve discomfort and restore function in hand and arm movements caused by injuries and nerve and muscle complications. The system trains patients with hand exercises, such as performing hand gestures accurately, traversing within specified bounds, and operating a hand gesture calculator. However, the system requires accurate hand gesture detection, which is impeded by background clutter and variations in illumination and in the hand's size and angle. To address this, we developed a robust hand detection module that uses a single-stage transformer deep network. The transformer network encodes global information and uses bipartite matching to reduce the frequency of spurious detections. It drives a regression head and a classification head to localize the hand gesture in a bounding box and assign it a class label. Hand keypoints are …",0,"A Hand Gesture-operated System for Rehabilitation using an End-to-End Detection Framework

Retinal vessel segmentation using multi-scale residual convolutional neural network (MSR-Net) combined with generative adversarial networks,"Mithun Kumar Kar, Debanga Raj Neog, Malaya Kumar Nath",2023/2,"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing",42.0,2.0,Springer US,"Retinal fundus images provide valuable diagnostic and clinical information in the diagnosis of ophthalmologic diseases. Retinal blood vessel analysis provides important diagnostic information about thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer and alteration in the structural appearance of the optic nerve head. Here, an accurate retinal vessel detection method is proposed from fundus images using a generative adversarial network (GAN) utilizing multiple loss functions. The proposed GAN architecture consists of the generator as a segmentation network and the discriminator as a classification network. The generator is a multi-scale residual convolutional neural network with skip connection and up-sampling, while the discriminator is a vision transformer that acts as a binary classifier. The inception module extracts multi-scale features of vessel segments from different scales and captures fine vessel segments.

Two-Stage Hand Gesture Recognition based on Hand Keypoints Localization,"Debanga Raj Neog, MK Bhuyan, Mousumi Das, RH Lashkar",2022/3/24,,,,IEEE,"Hand gesture is an important component of non-verbal communication, and the appropriate categorization of the gestures is quintessential for fruitful communication. Hand gestures are used in many human-computer interfaces for their natural and simplistic contactless way of conveying instruction to the interface. However, the recognition of hand gestures is complicated by numerous factors. This paper addresses a few issues by proposing a two-stage recognition framework that uses a hand joint localization technique. Firstly, the proposed method predicts hand keypoints that localize the region of interest by encompassing the hand region through a bounding box. Subsequently, this region of interest is used in gesture recognizing. The proposed work uses only one input modality-RGB image and performs phenomenally despite background clutter and illumination variation.",0,"Two-Stage Hand Gesture Recognition based on Hand Keypoints Localization

Contextual emotion learning challenge,"Jainendra Shukla, Puneet Gupta, Aniket Bera, Arka Sarkar, Prakhar Goel, Shubhangi Butta, Anup Kumar Gupta, Snehil Sanyal, Debanga Rai Neog, MK Bhuyan, Kalyani Marathe, Linda Shapiro, Alex Colbrn, Varchita Lalwani",2021/12/15,,,,IEEE,"Emotion recognition via vision has been deeply associated with facial expressions, and the inference of emotions has, more often than not, been based on the same. However, context, both environmental and social, plays an imperative role in emotion recognition but has not been incorporated widely so far. The meaning of emotion might entirely switch when shifted from one setting to another if only facial expressions are taken into account. Moreover, there exists no study in the Indian context about the same. To cater to this issue, we generate and introduce the Indian Contextual Emotion Recognition (ICER) dataset based on the multi-ethnic Indian context.

A review on progress in semantic image segmentation and its application to medical images,"Mithun Kumar Kar, Malaya Kumar Nath, Debanga Raj Neog",2021/9,,2.0,5.0,Springer Singapore,"Semantic image segmentation is a popular image segmentation technique where each pixel in an image is labeled with an object class. This technique has become a vital part of image analysis nowadays as it facilitates the description, categorization, and visualization of the regions of interest in an image. The recent developments in computer vision algorithms and the increasing availability of large datasets have made semantic image segmentation very popular in the field of computer vision. Motivated by the human visual system which can identify objects in a complex scene very efficiently, researchers are interested in building a model that can semantically segment an image into meaningful object classes. This paper reviews deep learning-based semantic segmentation techniques that use deep neural network architectures for image segmentation of biomedical images. We have provided a discussion …",10,"A review on progress in semantic image segmentation and its application to medical images

Transfer Learning in Deep Neural Networks,"Debanga Raj Neog, Prithu Banerjee, Ritika Jain",2020,,,,,"In the traditional machine learning approaches of obtaining models from data, there is an inherent assumption that the training data and the future data both lie in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real world applications like medicine, where training data is very scarce or difficult to obtain; model acquisition becomes a challenge. For instance, we may have a classification task in one domain of interest whereas sufficient training data is available in a different domain of interest. The latter domain may have a different feature space or follow a different distribution from the one we are interested in. In such cases, carrying forward the structural properties of a model learned in a source domain where training data is ample and reusing it partially or fully in a target domain can save us expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning approach and this survey focuses on various DNN architectures, different training methods adopted to train those and their performance in several application domains.",1,"Transfer Learning in Deep Neural Networks

The human touch: Measuring contact with real human soft tissues,"Dinesh K Pai, Austin Rothwell, Pearson Wyder-Hodge, Alistair Wick, Ye Fan, Egor Larionov, Darcy Harrison, Debanga Raj Neog, Cole Shing",2018/7/30,ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),37.0,4.0,ACM,"Simulating how the human body deforms in contact with external objects, tight clothing, or other humans is of central importance to many fields. Despite great advances in numerical methods, the material properties required to accurately simulate the body of a real human have been sorely lacking. Here we show that mechanical properties of the human body can be directly measured using a novel hand-held device. We describe a complete pipeline for measurement, modeling, parameter estimation, and simulation using the finite element method. We introduce a phenomenological model (the sliding thick skin model) that is effective for both simulation and parameter estimation. Our data also provide new insights into how the human body actually behaves. The methods described here can be used to create personalized models of an individual human or of a population. Consequently, our methods have many …",26,"The human touch: Measuring contact with real human soft tissues

Measurement and animation of the eye region of the human face in reduced coordinates,Debanga Raj Neog,2018,,,,,"The goal of this dissertation is to develop methods to measure, model, and animate facial tissues of the region around the eyes, referred to as the eye region. First, we measure the subtle movements of the soft tissues of the eye region using a monocular RGB-D camera setup, and second, we model and animate these movements using parameterized motion models. The muscles and skin of the eye region are very thin and sheetlike. By representing these tissues as thin elastic sheets in reduced coordinates, we have shown how we can measure and animate these tissues efficiently. To measure tissue movements, we optically track both eye and skin motions using monocular video sequences. The key idea here is to use a reduced coordinates framework to model thin sheet-like facial skin of the eye region. This framework implicitly constrains skin to conform to the shape of the underlying object when it slides. The skin configuration can then be efficiently reconstructed in 3D by tracking two dimensional skin features in video. This reduced coordinates model allows interactive real-time animation of the eye region in WebGL enabled devices using a small number of animation parameters, including gaze. Additionally, we have shown that the same reduced coordinates framework can also be used for physics-based simulation of the facial tissue movements and to produce tissue deformations that occur in facial expressions. We validated our skin measurement and animation algorithms using skin movement sequences with known skin motions, and we can recover skin sliding motions with low reconstruction errors. We also propose an image-based …",1,"Measurement and animation of the eye region of the human face in reduced coordinates
