Dynamic Data Assimilation for Improved Streamflow Forecast Using Sensitive Soil Moisture Observations,"Ramesh Visweshwaran, Raaj Ramsankaran, TI Eldho, S Lakshmivarahan",2022/11/22,Authorea Preprints,,,Authorea,"The accuracy of streamflow forecasts is important for efficient monitoring and mitigation of flood events. Unfortunately, the uncertainty in the model control variable which includes model parameters, initial and boundary conditions, propagates through the model, resulting in the degradation of streamflow forecast. Various studies in the past have shown the potential of soil moisture assimilation in hydrological models resulting in the improved forecast. Further, the efficiency of assimilation is based on the number and the distribution of observations used. This study proposes a new approach called Forward sensitivity method (FSM), which operates in two phases. By running the model and forecast sensitivity dynamics forward in time, the first phase places the observations at or near where the square of the forecast sensitivity with respect to the control takes maximum values. Then using only this subset of observations, the second phase estimates the unknown elements of the control by solving a resulting weighted least squares problem. The power of this approach is demonstrated by assimilating ASCAT soil moisture observations into a conceptual Two Parameter Model in a medium sized watershed lying in the Krishna River Basin, India. The model run extends for four monsoon years from June 2007 to June 2011 and two assimilation scenarios were tested. The first scenario uses all the observations, whereas, the second uses only sensitive observations during assimilation and the results were then compared against open loop simulation (model run without assimilation). Sensitivity results indicate that observations during monsoon time alone are …",0,"Dynamic Data Assimilation for Improved Streamflow Forecast Using Sensitive Soil Moisture Observations

Role of the Observability Gramian in Parameter Estimation: Application to Nonchaotic and Chaotic Systems via the Forward Sensitivity Method,"John M Lewis, Sivaramakrishnan Lakshmivarahan",2022/10/10,Atmosphere,13.0,10.0,MDPI,"Data assimilation in chaotic regimes is challenging, and among the challenging aspects is placement of observations to induce convexity of the cost function in the space of control. This problem is examined by using Saltzman’s spectral model of convection that admits both chaotic and nonchaotic regimes and is controlled by two parameters—Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. The problem is simplified by stripping the seven-variable constraint to a three-variable constraint. Since emphasis is placed on observation positioning to avoid cost-function flatness, forecast sensitivity to controls is needed. Four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) is silent on this issue of observation placement while Forecast Sensitivity Method (FSM) delivers sensitivities used in placement. With knowledge of the temporal forecast sensitivity matrix V, derivatives of the forecast variables to controls, the cost function can be expressed as a function of the observability Gramian VTV using first-order Taylor series expansion. The goal is to locate observations at places that force the Gramian positive definite. Further, locations are chosen such that the condition number of VTV is small and this guarantees convexity in the vicinity of the cost function minimum. Four numerical experiments are executed, and results are compared with the structure of the cost function independently determined though arduous computation over a wide range of the two nondimensional numbers. The results are especially good based on reduction in cost function value and comparison with cost function structure.",0,"Role of the Observability Gramian in Parameter Estimation: Application to Nonchaotic and Chaotic Systems via the Forward Sensitivity Method

Sensitivity‐Based Soil Moisture Assimilation for Improved Streamflow Forecast Using a Novel Forward Sensitivity Method (FSM) Approach,"R Visweshwaran, RAAJ Ramsankaran, TI Eldho, S Lakshmivarahan",2022/1,Water Resources Research,58.0,1.0,,"The need for and the use of different data assimilation techniques to improve the quality of streamflow forecast is now well established. In this paper, the goal is to demonstrate the power of a new class of methods known as the forward sensitivity method (FSM) which is based on the temporal evolution of model sensitivities with respect to the control variables consisting of initial conditions and parameters. FSM operates in two phases: the first phase provides a simple algorithm for placing observations at or near where the square of forward sensitivities attains their maximum values.

Forward Sensitivity Analysis of the FitzHugh–Nagumo System: Parameter Estimation,"Shady E Ahmed, Omer San, Sivaramakrishnan Lakshmivarahan",2021/7/5,,,,Springer International Publishing,"The FitzHugh–Nagumo (FHN) model, from computational neuroscience, has attracted attention in nonlinear dynamics studies as it describes the behavior of excitable systems and exhibits interesting bifurcation properties. The accurate estimation of the model parameters is vital to understand how the solution trajectory evolves in time. To this end, we provide a forward sensitivity method (FSM) approach to quantify the main model parameters using sparse measurement data. FSM constitutes a variational data assimilation technique which integrates model sensitivities into the process of fitting the model to the observations. We analyze the applicability of FSM to update the FHN model parameters and predict its dynamical characteristics. Furthermore, we highlight a few guidelines for observations placement to control the shape of the cost functional and improve the parameter inference iterations.",0,"Forward Sensitivity Analysis of the FitzHugh–Nagumo System: Parameter Estimation

Placement of observations to correct return-flow forecasts,"John M Lewis, S Lakshmivarahan, Junjun Hu, Robert Rabin",2020,,15.0,,,"The continued presence of systematic errors in operational forecasts of return flow over the Gulf of Mexico has motivated an investigation into this problem. The theme of the work is use of a low-order mixed-layer model that is faithful to the phenomenon in the context of dynamic data assimilation. Data assimilation experiments in the identical-twin mode determine the best place to make observations that minimize the forecast error through adjustment of model controls. The emphasized controls are those associated with the fluxes of heat and moisture from sea to atmosphere. Results indicate that the best observations are at that time and place when the outflowing continental air passes over the warmest sea surface temperatures. In the case studied, this warmest zone is directly over the Loop Current. Observations at times long after the modified air leaves these warmest waters lead to relatively poor control adjustments and little improvement in the forecast. If input to data assimilation is restricted to observations of a single model variable over short intervals of time (the order of several hours), results are relatively poor. Yet, a significant improvement is forthcoming if one of the observations is replaced by an observation from another model variable. This result is understood through arguments based on forecast sensitivity to model control. The paper ends with discussion of steps to be taken that hold promise for correcting systematic error in return-flow forecasts.",2,"Placement of observations to correct return-flow forecasts

One of the most important means of achieving this is to use spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets of critical aerosol properties, such as spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA), which are the most important parameters for estimating aerosol radiative effects. However, observations do not provide the above; the space-borne observations though provide wide spatial coverage, are temporal snapshots and suffer from possible sensor degradation over extended periods. On the other hand, the ground-based measurements provide more accurate and temporally continuous data but are spatially near-point observations. Realizing the need for spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets on one hand and the near non-existence of such data over the south Asian region (which is one of the regions where aerosols show large heterogeneity in most of their properties), construction of accurate gridded aerosol products by synthesizing the long-term space-borne and ground-based data has been taken up as an important objective of the South West Asian Aerosol Monsoon Interactions (SWAAMI), a joint Indo-UK field campaign, aiming at characterizing aerosol–monsoon links and their variabilities over the Indian region.
