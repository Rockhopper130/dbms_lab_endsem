DEBay: A computational tool for deconvolution of quantitative PCR data for estimation of cell type-specific gene expression in a mixed population,"Vimalathithan Devaraj, Biplab Bose",2020/7,Heliyon,6.0,7.0,Cell Press,"The expression of a gene is commonly estimated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using RNA isolated from a large number of pooled cells. Such pooled samples often have subpopulations of cells with different levels of expression of the target gene. Estimation of gene expression from an ensemble of cells obscures the pattern of expression in different subpopulations. Physical separation of various subpopulations is a demanding task. We have developed a computational tool, Deconvolution of Ensemble through Bayes-approach (DEBay), to estimate cell type-specific gene expression from qPCR data of a mixed population. DEBay estimates Normalized Gene Expression Coefficient (NGEC), which is a relative measure of the expression of the target gene in each cell type in a population. NGEC has a direct algebraic correspondence with the normalized fold change in gene expression measured by qPCR.

The Mathematics of Phenotypic State Transition: Paths and Potential,"Vimalathithan Devaraj, Biplab Bose",2020,Journal of the Indian Institute of Science,100.0,3.0,Springer India,"Change in the phenotype of a cell is considered as a transition of a cell from one cellular state to another. Cellular state transition can be driven by an external cue or by the noise in molecular processes. Over the years, generalized physical principles, and associated mathematical models have been developed to understand phenotypic state transition. Starting with Waddington’s epigenetic landscape, phenotypic state transition is seen as a movement of cells on a potential landscape. Though the landscape model is close to the thermodynamic principles of state change, it is difficult to envisage it from experimental observations. Therefore, phenotypic state transition is often considered as a discrete state jump process. This approach is particularly useful to estimate the paths of state transition from experimental observations. In this review, we discuss both of these approaches and the associated mathematical …",4,"The mathematics of phenotypic state transition: paths and potential

Peptides derived from a short stretch of diphtheria toxin bind to heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor,"Mahesh Agarwal, Tanmay Mondal, Biplab Bose",2019/11/1,Toxicon,169.0,,Pergamon,"Membrane-anchored heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is the receptor for diphtheria toxin (DT). Mutated or truncated, non-toxic DT has been used earlier for HB-EGF-targeted drug delivery and to modulate HB-EGF signaling. In the present work, we have synthesized a peptide corresponding to a 26 amino acid long stretch of the receptor-binding domain of DT. This region of DT makes multiple contacts with HB-EGF and has residues critical for binding to HB-EGF. We show that this peptide and two of its mutants bind to HB-EGF. We have also created recombinant proteins by fusing Maltose-binding Protein (MBP) with these peptides. These recombinant MBP-tagged peptides bind to HB-EGF with affinities in the range of 10−7 to 10−8 M. We have observed that these MBP-tagged peptides can modulate molecular signaling of HB-EGF. Therefore, this 26 amino acid long stretch of DT can be considered …",1,"Peptides derived from a short stretch of diphtheria toxin bind to heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor

Percolation in a reduced equilibrium model of planar cell polarity,"Kamleswar Chandrasekaran, Biplab Bose",2019/9/17,Physical Review E,100.0,3.0,American Physical Society,"Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a biological phenomenon where a large number of cells get polarized and coordinatedly align in a plane. PCP is an example of self-organization through local and global interactions between cells. In this work, we have used a lattice-based spin model for PCP that mimics the alignment of cells through local interactions. We have investigated the equilibrium behavior of this model. In this model, alignment of cells leads to the formation of clusters of aligned cells, and such clustering exhibits percolation transition. Even though the alignment of a cell in this model depends upon its neighbors, finite-size scaling analysis shows that this model belongs to the universality class of simple two-dimensional random percolation.",2,"Percolation in a reduced equilibrium model of planar cell polarity

Morphological state transition dynamics in EGF-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition,"Vimalathithan Devaraj, Biplab Bose",2019/6/26,Journal of clinical medicine,8.0,7.0,MDPI,"Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a multi-state process. Here, we investigated phenotypic state transition dynamics of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)-induced EMT in a breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468. We have defined phenotypic states of these cells in terms of their morphologies and have shown that these cells have three distinct morphological states—cobble, spindle, and circular. The spindle and circular states are the migratory phenotypes. Using quantitative image analysis and mathematical modeling, we have deciphered state transition trajectories in different experimental conditions. This analysis shows that the phenotypic state transition during EGF-induced EMT in these cells is reversible, and depends upon the dose of EGF and level of phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR). The dominant reversible state transition trajectory in this system was cobble to circular to spindle to cobble. We have observed that there exists an ultrasensitive on/off switch involving phospho-EGFR that decides the transition of cells in and out of the circular state. In general, our observations can be explained by the conventional quasi-potential landscape model for phenotypic state transition. As an alternative to this model, we have proposed a simpler discretized energy-level model to explain the observed state transition dynamics.",39,"Morphological state transition dynamics in EGF-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition

Final Draft Authors Copy,Biplab Bose,,,,,,"The debate over reductionism and antireductionism in biology is very old. Even the systems approach in biology is more than five decades old. However, mainstream biology, particularly experimental biology, has broadly sidestepped those debates and ideas. Post-genome data explosion and development of high-throughput techniques led to resurfacing of those ideas and debates as a new incarnation called Systems Biology. Though experimental biologists have co-opted systems biology and hailed it as a paradigm shift, it is practiced in different shades and understood with divergent meanings. Biology has certain questions linked with organization of multiple components and processes. Often such questions involve multilevel systems. Here in this essay we argue that systems theory provides required framework and abstractions to explore those questions. We argue that systems biology should follow the logical and mathematical approach of systems theory and transmogrification of systems biology to mere collection of higher dimensional data must be avoided. Therefore, the questions that we ask and the priority of those questions should also change. Systems biology should focus on systemlevel properties and investigate complexity without shying away from it.",0,"Final Draft Authors Copy
