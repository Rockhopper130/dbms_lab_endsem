Multi-cultural speech emotion recognition using language and speaker cues,"Sandeep Kumar Pandey, Hanumant Singh Shekhawat, SRM Prasanna",2023/5/1,Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,83.0,,Elsevier,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has been an active area of research to make Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) smoother and more natural. However, due to the dependence of the expressed emotions in an utterance on factors like culture, speaker, etc., the robustness of the SER systems in a multi-cultural setting is always a topic of discussion among researchers. Both the universalness and cultural specificity of emotions are debated in the literature. Thus we propose two methods, one incorporating cultural specificity and another demonstrating the universal nature of emotions across cultures. In this work, we propose a novel method to make a multi-cultural SER by incorporating impactful factors such as speaker and language as markers of cultural distinctiveness. We develop a language and a speaker model to get language and speaker embeddings, and a multi-modal fusion architecture is proposed to …",0,"Multi-cultural speech emotion recognition using language and speaker cues

A Longitudinal Study of the Emotional Content in Indian Political Speeches,"Sandeep Kumar Pandey, Mohit Manohar Nirgulkar, Hanumant Singh Shekhawat",2023/4/11,,,,Springer Nature Switzerland,"Emotions are an impacting factor when public speaking is concerned. Mainly, politicians utilize emotion in their public speeches as a tool to generate a better connection with the audience. As such, this study proposes a longitudinal study of emotional content in speeches of Indian politicians, encompassing several primary elections over 15 years. A speech emotion dataset is proposed for the same, annotated using human annotators. We also present experimental analysis on the collected dataset using a standard approach such as Attention-based CNN+LSTM architectures and transfer learning using multiple standard emotion datasets. The model achieves a recognition accuracy of 73.18% using pre-training. A longitudinal study spanning over three Lok Sabha elections is also presented, demonstrating how the politicians modulate emotions in speech over several elections.",0,"A Longitudinal Study of the Emotional Content in Indian Political Speeches

A deep tensor-based approach for automatic depression recognition from speech utterances,"Sandeep Kumar Pandey, Hanumant Singh Shekhawat, SRM Prasanna, Shalendar Bhasin, Ravi Jasuja",2022/8/11,Plos one,17.0,8.0,Public Library of Science,"Depression is one of the significant mental health issues affecting all age groups globally. While it has been widely recognized to be one of the major disease burdens in populations, complexities in definitive diagnosis present a major challenge. Usually, trained psychologists utilize conventional methods including individualized interview assessment and manually administered PHQ-8 scoring. However, heterogeneity in symptomatic presentations, which span somatic to affective complaints, impart substantial subjectivity in its diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy is further compounded by the cross-sectional nature of sporadic assessment methods during physician-office visits, especially since depressive symptoms/severity may evolve over time. With widespread acceptance of smart wearable devices and smartphones, passive monitoring of depression traits using behavioral signals such as speech presents a unique opportunity as companion diagnostics to assist the trained clinicians in objective assessment over time. Therefore, we propose a framework for automated depression classification leveraging alterations in speech patterns in the well documented and extensively studied DAIC-WOZ depression dataset. This novel tensor-based approach requires a substantially simpler implementation architecture and extracts discriminative features for depression recognition with high f1 score and accuracy. We posit that such algorithms, which use significantly less compute load would allow effective onboard deployment in wearables for improve diagnostics accuracy and real-time monitoring of depressive disorders.",0,"A deep tensor-based approach for automatic depression recognition from speech utterances

A New Framework for Artificial Bandwidth Extension Using  Filtering,"Deepika Gupta, Hanumant Singh Shekhawat, Rohit Sinha",2022/5,"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing",41.0,5.0,Springer US,"This work proposes a new artificial bandwidth extension (ABE) framework for enhancing the quality of narrowband speech signals. This enhancement process recovers missing high-frequency components of the signal. In this regard, a new bandwidth extension process based on sampled-data control theory and machine learning models is proposed. In addition, a little non-ideality (aliasing) is allowed in the narrowband signal to get better reconstruction for the missing higher frequencies. The sampled-data control theory works on a signal model, representing the already available wideband signal. Direct use of this theory is not possible in the bandwidth extension process as the signal models may not be the same for different phonemes of speech signals, even if uttered by the same speaker due to their non-stationary behavior.

Design and implementation of a low power area efficient Bfloat16 based CORDIC processor,"Saras Mani Mishra, Hanumant Singh Shekhawat, Gaurav Trivedi, Pidanic Jan, Zdenek Nemec",2022/4/21,,,,IEEE,"Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm has a great advantage in hardware based implementation because of its simple architecture. It employs shifter and adder for hardware implementation. The major issue with a CORDIC algorithm is the linear dependence of convergence on the number of iterations. Each iteration performs shift and addition or subtraction operations, due to this there is a trade off between area and delay. Also, the floating-point representation of angles would also increase the area and power. The main aim of this work is to implement a low power and area efficient bfloat16 based on a CORDIC algorithm. The proposed hardware module consumes and less area and power compared to a single-precision floating-point based CORDIC implementation.
