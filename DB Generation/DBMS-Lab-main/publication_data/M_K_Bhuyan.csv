Can Adversarial Networks Make Uninformative Colonoscopy Video Frames Clinically Informative?,"Vanshali Sharma, MK Bhuyan, Pradip K Das",2023/4/4,arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.02152,,,,"Various artifacts, such as ghost colors, interlacing, and motion blur, hinder diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC) from videos acquired during colonoscopy. The frames containing these artifacts are called uninformative frames and are present in large proportions in colonoscopy videos. To alleviate the impact of artifacts, we propose an adversarial network based framework to convert uninformative frames to clinically relevant frames. We examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach by evaluating the translated frames for polyp detection using YOLOv5. Preliminary results present improved detection performance along with elegant qualitative outcomes. We also examine the failure cases to determine the directions for future work.",0,"Can Adversarial Networks Make Uninformative Colonoscopy Video Frames Clinically Informative?

A Hand Gesture-operated System for Rehabilitation using an End-to-End Detection Framework,"H Pallab Jyoti Dutta, MK Bhuyan, Debanga Raj Neog, Karl F MacDorman, RH Laskar",2023/3/2,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,,,IEEE,"We propose a hand gesture-operated system as an AI application to relieve discomfort and restore function in hand and arm movements caused by injuries and nerve and muscle complications. The system trains patients with hand exercises, such as performing hand gestures accurately, traversing within specified bounds, and operating a hand gesture calculator. However, the system requires accurate hand gesture detection, which is impeded by background clutter and variations in illumination and in the hand's size and angle. To address this, we developed a robust hand detection module that uses a single-stage transformer deep network.

"Detection, tracking, and recognition of isolated multi-stroke gesticulated characters","Kuldeep Singh Yadav, Anish Monsley Kirupakaran, Rabul Hussain Laskar, MK Bhuyan",2023/2/23,Pattern Analysis and Applications,,,Springer London,"The detection and tracking of the bare hand are the most vital stages in the bare hand gesticulated character recognition system. Applying detection and tracking in an uncontrolled environment is quite challenging due to the variations in pose, position, illumination, occlusion, scale, rotation, speed, and bare hand-like impostors in the background or foreground. The motion blur due to speed variation makes it more complex. A computationally efficient object localization approach, i.e., region-based convolutional neural network on the selective region (RCNN-SR), is introduced in this work to detect the bare hand by overcoming these challenges at a certain level.

Efficient Context Integration through Factorized Pyramidal Learning for Ultra-Lightweight Semantic Segmentation,"Nadeem Atif, Saquib Mazhar, Debajit Sarma, MK Bhuyan, Shaik Rafi Ahamed",2023/2/23,arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.11785,,,,"Semantic segmentation is a pixel-level prediction task to classify each pixel of the input image. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been extremely successful in achieving excellent performances in this domain. However, mobile application, such as autonomous driving, demand real-time processing of incoming stream of images. Hence, achieving efficient architectures along with enhanced accuracy is of paramount importance. Since, accuracy and model size of CNNs are intrinsically contentious in nature, the challenge is to achieve a decent trade-off between accuracy and model size. To address this, we propose a novel Factorized Pyramidal Learning (FPL) module to aggregate rich contextual information in an efficient manner. On one hand, it uses a bank of convolutional filters with multiple dilation rates which leads to multi-scale context aggregation; crucial in achieving better accuracy. On the other hand, parameters are reduced by a careful factorization of the employed filters; crucial in achieving lightweight models. Moreover, we decompose the spatial pyramid into two stages which enables a simple and efficient feature fusion within the module to solve the notorious checkerboard effect. We also design a dedicated Feature-Image Reinforcement (FIR) unit to carry out the fusion operation of shallow and deep features with the downsampled versions of the input image. This gives an accuracy enhancement without increasing model parameters.

Lymph node detection in CT scans using modified U-Net with residual learning and 3D deep network,"Yashwanth Manjunatha, Vanshali Sharma, Yuji Iwahori, MK Bhuyan, Aili Wang, Akira Ouchi, Yasuhiro Shimizu",2023/1/11,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,,,Springer International Publishing,"Purpose
Lymph node (LN) detection is a crucial step that complements the diagnosis and treatments involved during cancer investigations. However, the low-contrast structures in the CT scan images and the nodes’ varied shapes, sizes, and poses, along with their sparsely distributed locations, make the detection step challenging and lead to many false positives. The manual examination of the CT scan slices could be time-consuming, and false positives could divert the clinician’s focus. To overcome these issues, our work aims at providing an automated framework for LNs detection in order to obtain more accurate detection results with low false positives.

Development of an intelligent recognition system for dynamic mid-air gesticulation of isolated alphanumeric keys,"Anish Monsley Kirupakaran, Kuldeep Singh Yadav, Rabul Hussain Laskar, Manas Kamal Bhuyan",2022/12/30,Expert Systems with Applications,210.0,,Pergamon,"Detecting and recognizing naturally gesticulated characters in mid-air is difficult because of the complexity arising due to (i) gesticulation style; (ii) gesture’s pattern and size. This worsens further when the gesticulation speed is faster causing the gesture object to be blurred in some of the frames. To ensure that the trajectory formed is equivalent to the intended gesticulation and be robust to the impostor’s presence, we propose red marker-detection and tracking (RM-DT) approach. This uses channel subtraction, thresholding, compact (hand) criteria, and Kalman filter to detect and track the gesture object to form the gesture trajectory (accuracy of ∼96 %; mAP – 0.9419). Unlike handwritten characters, the gesticulated trajectory incorporates the self co-articulated strokes that increases the rate of misclassification at the recognition stage.

Self co‐articulations are intentional movements performed by an individual to complete a gesture, whose presence in the trajectory alters its original meaning. For recognition, most researchers have directly used the trajectory formed along with these self co‐articulated strokes, with a few removing it using visible trait‐like velocity. Usage of velocity has shortcomings as gesturing in air differs from gesturing over a solid surface; hence, we propose a gesture formation model, which incorporates global and local measures to remove these self co‐articulations.

Technol.,7.0,5,,"In recent times, several studies focused on the global warming that may affect the hydrological cycle due to intensification of temporal and spatial variations in precipitation. Such climatic change is likely to impact significantly upon freshwater resources availability. In India, demand for water has already increased manifold over the years due to urbanization, agriculture expansion, increasing population, rapid industrialization and economic development. Numerous scientific studies also report increases in the intensity, duration, and spatial extents of floods, higher atmospheric temperatures, warmer sea, changes in precipitation patterns, and changing groundwater levels. This work briefly discusses about the present scenario regarding impact of climate change on water resources in India. Due to the insufficient resolution of climate models and their generally crude representation of sub-grid scale and convective processes, little confidence can be placed in any definite predictions of such effects, although a tendency for more heavy rainfall events seems likely, and a modest increase in frequency in floods. Thus to analyses this effect, this work considers real problems about the changing flood characteristics pattern in two river regions, and the effect of spatial and temporal pattern in rainfall. In addition to these, the work also examines the trend of groundwater level fluctuations in few blocks of Ganga–Yamuna and Sutlej-Yamuna Link interfluves region. As a whole, it examines the potential for sustainable development of surface water and groundwater resources within the constraints imposed by climate change.",1,"A Review of Case Studies on Climate Change Impact on Hydrologic Cycle: An Indian Perspective

But, it requires more than one cardiovascular signals involving more than one sensing device. In this paper, we propose a method for continuous cuffless blood pressure measurement with the help of left ventricular ejection time (LVET). The LVET is estimated using a signal obtained through a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor. The sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are estimated by calibrating the system with the original arterial blood pressure values of the subjects. The proposed method is evaluated using different quantitative measures on the signals collected from ten subjects under the supine position. The performance of the proposed method is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are estimated from electrocardiogram (ECG)-photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG-PPG, respectively. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods.

In a broad range of areas hand gesture techniques can be applied specifically in sign language recognition, robotic surgery, etc. In the process of hand gesture recognition, proper detection, and tracking of the moving hand become challenging due to the varied shape and size of the hand. Here the objective is to track the movement of the hand irrespective of the shape, size, and color of the hand. And, for this, a motion template guided by optical flow (OFMT) is proposed. OFMT is a compact representation of the motion information of a gesture encoded into a single image. In the experimentation, different datasets using bare hand with an open palm, and folded palm wearing green-glove are used, and in both cases, we could generate the OFMT images with equal precision.

A novel algorithm for shot boundary detection and segmentation of broadcast news videos,"Pranabjyoti Haloi, MK Bhuyan, Pooja Rani Borah, Dibyajyoti Chatterjee",2020/7/2,,,,IEEE,"News videos are an important means of conveying information. But the number of news broadcasted each day in a particular channel is very large and considering the number of news channels, it is a huge amount of information conveyed each day. Sorting of news videos plays a very important role in such cases to create a well-categorized database of news videos. Broadcast news video shot segmentation is one of the vital parts of sorting. This paper presents a novel algorithm that can detect the shot boundaries of news videos efficiently and perform shot segmentation accordingly.

Image specific discriminative feature extraction for skin segmentation,"Biplab Ketan Chakraborty, Manas Kamal Bhuyan",2020/7,Multimedia Tools and Applications,79.0,27-28,Springer US,"In recent times, the majority of colour-based skin detection methods used skin modelling in different colour spaces, and they are capable of skin classification at a pixel level. However, the accuracy of these methods is significantly affected by different issues, such as the presence of skin-like colours in scene background, variations in skin pigmentation, scene illumination, etc. Recent developments show that the discriminating power of a colour-based skin classifier can be increased by employing texture and spatial features. However, we observed that discriminability between skin and non-skin regions does not follow any statistics, and the discrimination is extremely image specific. In this paper, a novel adaptive discriminative analysis (ADA) is proposed to extract most discriminant features between skin and non-skin regions from an image itself in an unsupervised manner.

Design of breathing-states detector for m-health platform using seismocardiographic signal,"Tilendra Choudhary, LN Sharma, MK Bhuyan, Kangkana Bora",2020/2/24,arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.10510,,,,"In this work, a seismocardiogram (SCG) based breathing-state measuring method is proposed for m-health applications. The aim of the proposed framework is to assess the human respiratory system by identifying degree-of-breathings, such as breathlessness, normal breathing, and long and labored breathing. For this, it is needed to measure cardiac-induced chest-wall vibrations, reflected in the SCG signal. Orthogonal subspace projection is employed to extract the SCG cycles with the help of a concurrent ECG signal. Subsequently, fifteen statistically significant morphological-features are extracted from each of the SCG cycles. These features can efficiently characterize physiological changes due to varying respiratory rates. Stacked autoencoder (SAE) based architecture is employed for the identification of different respiratory-effort levels. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with other standard classifiers for 1147 analyzed SCG-beats. The proposed method gives an overall average accuracy of 91.45% in recognizing three different breathing states. The quantitative analysis of the performance results clearly shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework. It may be employed in various healthcare applications, such as pre-screening medical sensors and IoT based remote health-monitoring systems.",7,"Design of breathing-states detector for m-health platform using seismocardiographic signal

Thereafter, we present an exhaustive analysis of approaches using different representations (ways to decompose a 3D VOI) as input to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), 3D CNN (convolutional neural network using 3D convolutions) classifier. We also evaluate SVMs trained on features extracted by the aforementioned CNN and 3D CNN.

Change in heart cycle morphologies is a vital diagnostic feature for cardiac clinical systems. A seismocardiogram (SCG) signal provides more detailed information of different cardiac phases in a heart cycle compared to other cardiac signals. Hence, heart cycle extraction using SCG is very important to examine cardiac activities. In this manuscript, an orthogonal subspace projection based framework is proposed to extract heart cycles from a SCG signal. The heart cycle is estimated by calculating intervals between consecutive aortic valve opening (AO) instants, and post aortic valve closing (postAC) instants. Orthogonal subspace projection is applied to the SCG signal on ECG subspace for AO peak detection. The signal generated from projection gives the locations of AO peaks in the SCG signal.

Polyp shapes play an important role in colorectal diagnosis. However, endoscopy images are usually composed of nonrigid objects such as a polyp. Hence, it is challenging for polyp shape recovery. It is demanded to establish a support system of the colorectal diagnosis system based on polyp shape.
Introduction:
Shape from Shading (SFS) is one valuable approach based on photoclinometry for polyp shape recovery. SFS and endoscope image are compatible on the first sight, but there are constraints for applying SFS to endoscope image. Those approaches need some parameters like a depth from the endoscope lens to the surface, and surface reflectance factor. Furthermore, those approaches assume the whole surface which has the same value of for the Lambertian surface.
Methods:
This paper contributes to mitigating constraint for applying SFS to the endoscope image based on a cue from the medical structure. An extracted medical suture is used to estimate parameters, and a method of polyp shape recovery method is proposed using both geometric and photometric constraint equations. Notably, the proposed method realizes polyp shape recovery from a single endoscope image.
Results:
From experiments it was confirmed that the approximate polyp model shape was recovered and the proposed method recovered absolute size and shape of polyp using medical suture information and obtained parameters from a single endoscope image.
Conclusion:
This paper proposed a polyp shape recovery method which mitigated the constraint for applying SFS to the endoscope image using the medical suture. Notably, the proposed …",1,"Polyp Shape Recovery from Single Endoscope Image using Medical Suture

Deep network-based hand gesture recognition using optical flow guided trajectory images,"Amit Vishwakarma, Manas Kamal Bhuyan, Yuji Iwahori",2018,,,,Springer Singapore,"Multimodal medical image fusion techniques are utilized to fuse two images obtained from dissimilar sensors for obtaining additional information. These methods are used to fuse computed tomography (CT) images with magnetic resonance images (MRI), MR-T1 images with MR-T2 images, and MR images with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images. In proposed method, nonsubsampled shearlet transform (NSST) is used for decomposition of source images to attain the low-frequency and high-frequency bands. The low-frequency bands are fused using weighted saliency-based fusion criteria, and high-frequency bands are fused with the help of phase stretch transform (PST) features. Applying inverse NSST operation, fused image is obtained. The results show the proposed method produces better results compared to state-of-the-art methods.",1,"An efficient algorithm for medical image fusion using nonsubsampled shearlet transform

However this estimation depends on the experience and skill of medical doctor and it is sometimes necessary to use the medical thread with known size for estimating the size of polyp. This paper aims to help medical doctor by proposing a new approach to estimate the size and 3D shape of polyp as a medical supporting system.

In this paper, a 3-D shape reconstruction of computer vision technology is introduced in the medical diagnosis for this purpose. Some approaches based on Shape from Shading have been proposed for polyp in endoscope image. Previous approaches need some parameters such as depth parameter Z from endoscope lens to the surface point and reflectance parameter C. In the endoscope image, it is important to obtain these parameters for accurate polyp shape recovery. This paper proposes a new approach for obtaining parameters Z and C from one endoscope image where a medical suture is taken. A medical suture is used to estimate the horizontal plane locally and an observation model of medical suture is used with the horizontal plane. Two light sources endoscope observation system is assumed based on the actual endoscope for improving the accuracy of the polyp shape recovery.

The cropped images are used as input to CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and 4096-dimensional features are obtained in the final layer of the full connected layers. SVM (Support Vector Machine) is introduced for learning and classification using CNN features.

Study on production and extraction of negative impurity ions in a caesiated negative ion source,"PK Bhunya, AJ Adeloye, MK Bhuyan, Joygopal Jena, SOA ITER",,,,,,"A rainfall-runoff simulation model, based on a modified non-linear reservoir, is presented. The existing dynamic equation where storage in a catchment is defined as a function of only runoff is modified by introduction of a time lag parameter, which simplifies the equation to an explicit form. The method uses adjusted runoff (product of a coefficient and runoff) as a variable with accumulated storage with a time lag to establish a rainfall-runoff relationship. The performance of the model is tested on short-term rainfall and runoff data of two Indian catchments, and published data of Wills Creek and Shoal Creek. The coefficient of determination R 2 for the plot of runoff (QD) versus Storage S (t-τ) ranges from 0.83 to 0.975. The coefficient of the present non linear model defines against the storm magnitude and the R 2 value reaches up to 0.72. Further, the estimated flood hydrographs using the present approach are compared with the Nash (1959) model, and with the results given by optimization model of Mays and Taur (1982) and Prasad et al.(1999). The STDER values associated with the present nonlinear model are 4.4 and 79.8 for two study areas respectively, which are less compared to other approaches of Nash (1959), Mays & Taur (1982), Prasad et al.(1999)",0,"A Simple Non-Linear Rainfall-Runoff Model for Small Catchments

Some electrons because of their higher kinetic energy can break through the plasma creating a potential sheath layer by inducing a positive charge to quasineutral plasma [2]. This potential difference in the sheath layer pulls out ions from the plasma and accelerates them to higher energies in a very short time and lengthscale [3]. Evidently the most crucial role in this entire process is played by the ‘hot’electrons, which depends mainly on the efficient coupling of laser energy in to the plasma.
