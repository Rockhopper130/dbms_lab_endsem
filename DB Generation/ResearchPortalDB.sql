In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining regret guarantees for MAB problems in which the rewards of each arm form a Markov chain which may not belong to a single parameter exponential family. To achieve logarithmic regret in such problems is not difficult: a variation of standard Kullback-Leibler Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) does the job. However, the constants obtained from such an analysis are poor for the following reason: i.i.d. rewards are a special case of Markov rewards and it is difficult to design an algorithm that works well independent of whether the underlying model is truly Markovian or i.i.d. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm that identifies whether the rewards from each arm are truly Markovian or i.i.d. using a total variation distance-based test. Our algorithm then switches from using a standard KL-UCB to a specialized version of KL-UCB when it determines that the arm reward is Markovian, thus resulting in low regret for both i.i.d. and Markovian settings.', 'Adaptive KL-UCB based Bandit Algorithms for Markovian and iid Settings', 'Journal', 'arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.06606', 'Adaptive KL-UCB based Bandit Algorithms for Markovian and iid Settings A Roy, S Shakkottai, R Srikant - arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.06606, 2020 Related articles All 2 versions', 'nan', 'Arghyadip Roy, Sanjay Shakkottai, R Srikant', 2020, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Hand gestures are used in many human-computer interfaces for their natural and simplistic contactless way of conveying instruction to the interface. However, the recognition of hand gestures is complicated by numerous factors. This paper addresses a few issues by proposing a two-stage recognition framework that uses a hand joint localization technique. Firstly, the proposed method predicts hand keypoints that localize the region of interest by encompassing the hand region through a bounding box. Subsequently, this region of interest is used in gesture recognizing.

First, we measure the subtle movements of the soft tissues of the eye region using a monocular RGB-D camera setup, and second, we model and animate these movements using parameterized motion models. The muscles and skin of the eye region are very thin and sheetlike. By representing these tissues as thin elastic sheets in reduced coordinates, we have shown how we can measure and animate these tissues efficiently. To measure tissue movements, we optically track both eye and skin motions using monocular video sequences. The key idea here is to use a reduced coordinates framework to model thin sheet-like facial skin of the eye region. This framework implicitly constrains skin to conform to the shape of the underlying object when it slides. The skin configuration can then be efficiently reconstructed in 3D by tracking two dimensional skin features in video. This reduced coordinates model allows interactive real-time animation of the eye region in WebGL enabled devices using a small number of animation parameters, including gaze. Additionally, we have shown that the same reduced coordinates framework can also be used for physics-based simulation of the facial tissue movements and to produce tissue deformations that occur in facial expressions.

Resource-allocating platforms can point to this result as a justification for assigning good long-term outcomes to some agents and poor ones to others.

Similar to standard optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this additional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent (FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank structure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server can use to approximate clients\' gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM problem at the server using inexact gradient descent.

CausalSim uses traces from an initial RCT under a set of protocols to learn a causal network model, effectively removing the biases present in the data. Using this model, CausalSim can then simulate any protocol over the same traces (i.e., for counterfactual predictions). Key to CausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits distributional invariances that are present due to the training data coming from an RCT.

Traditionally, it is assumed that the entries of the matrix are \'missing completely at random\' (MCAR), i.e., each entry is revealed at random, independent of everything else, with uniform probability. This is likely unrealistic due to the presence of \'latent confounders\', i.e., unobserved factors that determine both the entries of the underlying matrix and the missingness pattern in the observed matrix. For example, in the context of movie recommender systems -- a canonical application for matrix completion -- a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is unlikely to ever watch horror films. In general, these confounders yield \'missing not at random\' (MNAR) data, which can severely impact any inference procedure that does not correct for this bias. We develop a formal causal model for matrix completion through the language of potential outcomes, and provide novel identification arguments for a variety of causal estimands of interest. We design a procedure, which we call \'synthetic nearest neighbors\' (SNN), to estimate these causal estimands. We prove finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator. Our analysis also leads to new theoretical results for the matrix completion literature. In particular, we establish entry-wise, i.e., max-norm, finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality results for matrix completion with MNAR data. As a special case, this also provides entry-wise bounds for matrix completion with MCAR data.

A game of skill is a game where the outcome is determined mainly by the predominance of mental or physical skill, rather than chance. Gambling or a game of chance is where outcomes are entirely driven by luck and skill has no role to play. In this work, we present a novel data-driven test that helps address this question. In particular, the failure of the test leads to the conclusion that the outcomes are based on the predominance of skill, and not based on luck. The proposed test is based on a sound statistical hypothesis of chance that we introduce. It is robust against all sorts of biases that might be present in the data. We apply the test to data obtained from two fantasy sports platforms: Dream11 for Cricket and FanDuel for Basketball.

Two key features in the analysis are in establishing (1) a meaningful upper bound on the sub-Gaussian norm for RUM components embedded into the vector space of pairwise marginals and (2) the robustness of PCA with missing values in the sense, which might be of interest in their own right.', 'Implicit feedback policies for COVID-19: why “zero-COVID” policies remain elusive', 'Journal', 'arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.11917', 'Learning RUMs: Reducing Mixture to Single Component via PCA D Shah, D Song - arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.11917, 2018 Cited by 2 Related articles All 2 versions', 'nan', 'Devavrat Shah, Dogyoon Song', 2018, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2),

This monograph aims to explain the success of these methods, both in theory, for which we cover foundational nonasymptotic statistical guarantees on nearest-neighbor-based regression and classification, and in practice, for which we gather prominent methods for approximate nearest neighbor search that have been essential to scaling prediction systems reliant on nearest neighbor analysis to handle massive datasets. Furthermore, we discuss connections to learning distances for use with nearest neighbor methods, including how random decision trees and ensemble methods learn nearest neighbor structure, as well as recent developments in crowdsourcing and graphons. In terms of theory, our focus is on nonasymptotic statistical guarantees, which we state in the form of how many training data and what algorithm parameters ensure that a nearest neighbor prediction method achieves a user-specified error tolerance. We begin with the most general of such results for nearest neighbor and related kernel regression and classification in general metric spaces. In such settings in which we assume very little structure, what enables successful prediction is smoothness in the function being estimated for regression, and a low probability of landing near the decision boundary for classification.

Study aimed to evaluate the Computed Tomography (CT) characteristics of SNIP and to correlate these characteristics with the finding of the origins of tumors.

We correlate SNIP characteristics with the detection of the origins of tumors described in the corresponding patient\'s medical records. We also assessed the CT features of hyperostosis according to the origin of tumors. Result: Surgical evaluation of 29 lesions with hyperostosis in CT images revealed that 23 of these lesions coincided with the virtual origin of tumor. The CT-based determination of the positions of the areas of hyperostosis corresponded to the actual tumor origin in 79.3% of cases. Specifically, in cases with hyperostosis within the maxillary, frontal, posterior and sphenoid, ethmoid sinuses, areas of hyperostosis corresponded to the origin of tumor without detraction. In the evaluation of the CT characteristics of hyperostosis, two patterns of localized bone thickening were noted.

The main idea of randomized algorithms is simply stated: Basing decisions on a few randomly chosen samples is often a good surrogate for basing decisions with complete knowledge of the state. This paper is about the design of randomized algorithms for switdi scheduling.

(11204, 'AlphaGo Zero (AGZ) introduced a new {em tabula rasa} reinforcement learning algorithm that has achieved superhuman performance in the games of Go, Chess, and Shogi with no prior knowledge other than the rules of the game. This success naturally begs the question whether it is possible to develop similar high-performance reinforcement learning algorithms for generic sequential decision-making problems (beyond two-player games), using only the constraints of the environment as the ``rules.\'\' To address this challenge, we start by taking steps towards developing a formal understanding of AGZ. AGZ includes two key innovations: (1) it learns a policy (represented as a neural network) using {em supervised learning} with cross-entropy loss from samples generated via Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS); (2) it uses {em self-play} to learn without training data. We argue that the self-play in AGZ corresponds to learning a Nash equilibrium for the two-player game; and the supervised learning with MCTS is attempting to learn the policy corresponding to the Nash equilibrium, by establishing a novel bound on the difference between the expected return achieved by two policies in terms of the expected KL divergence (cross-entropy) of their induced distributions. To extend AGZ to generic sequential decision-making problems, we introduce a {em robust MDP} framework, in which the agent and nature effectively play a zero-sum game: the agent aims to take actions to maximize reward while nature seeks state transitions, subject to the constraints of that environment, that minimize the agent\'s reward.

(11207, 'The central operational problem faced by managers is the prediction of revenues from various offer sets using the available historical sales data. Such revenue predictions form crucial inputs to assortment planning: deciding the “optimal” offer set with respect to a given objective (eg revenue) subject to various constraints (eg limited display or shelf space). Clearly, the offer set significantly impacts the choices made by the customers and, hence, the revenues and the margins seen by the seller. Therefore, it is the key decision problem, for instance, faced by retailers and has several variants depending on the desired objective and the imposed constraints. In all these variants, the key building block towards making such decisions is the procedure that estimates the revenue for a given offer set based on the historical sales data. Estimation of the revenues of a given offer set primarily requires two components:(1) prices of the products in the offer set and (2) the chance that a given product in the offer set is purchased by an incoming customer when the offer set is on display. Given prices of products, the revenue estimation boils down to predicting the share (fraction of sales) of each product in the offer set. This is challenging because of substitution behavior, where customers substitute an unavailable product with an available one. This makes the share observed for a product a combination of the primary demand for the product and the additional demand observed due to substitution. Clearly, capturing these substitution effects effectively is crucial to producing accurate revenue estimates.

Applications and instances of CPS are present in many diverse technological areas, including among others energy, transportation, telecommunications, environmental monitoring, biomedical and biological systems. Current CPS design suffers from many issues such as scalability, robustness, and performance satisfaction. In such systems, direct information about the physical world is usually acquired through a number of local entities, which can be geographically extended (eg, nervous system, sensor networks), and are often of a heterogeneous nature (eg, temperature, audio, chemical). The operation and performance requirements are global in nature, and are often represented and expressed in terms of aggregate properties of the overall system (eg, degree of maneuverability of an airplane, survival, prediction of power outage). The management of such systems entails the integration between a physical layer, which includes the underlying physical system as well as the fixed architectural constraints, and a virtual layer which addresses the design of the information layer and the supporting decision protocols which is designed to achieve a global set of objectives. The information layer is designed to be flexible, reconfigurable, and modular in order to deal with dynamic uncertainty, complexity, and resource limitations in communication and computation, and as a result, its design is intertwined with the decision systems.

However, heterogeneity in symptomatic presentations, which span somatic to affective complaints, impart substantial subjectivity in its diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy is further compounded by the cross-sectional nature of sporadic assessment methods during physician-office visits, especially since depressive symptoms/severity may evolve over time. With widespread acceptance of smart wearable devices and smartphones, passive monitoring of depression traits using behavioral signals such as speech presents a unique opportunity as companion diagnostics to assist the trained clinicians in objective assessment over time. Therefore, we propose a framework for automated depression classification leveraging alterations in speech patterns in the well documented and extensively studied DAIC-WOZ depression dataset. This novel tensor-based approach requires a substantially simpler implementation architecture and extracts discriminative features for depression recognition with high f1 score and accuracy. We posit that such algorithms, which use significantly less compute load would allow effective onboard deployment in wearables for improve diagnostics accuracy and real-time monitoring of depressive disorders.', 'A deep tensor-based approach for automatic depression recognition from speech utterances', 'Journal', 'Plos one', 'A deep tensor-based approach for automatic depression recognition from speech utterances SK Pandey, HS Shekhawat, SRM Prasanna, S Bhasin… - Plos one, 2022 Related articles All 5 versions', 'Public Library of Science', 'Sandeep Kumar Pandey, Hanumant Singh Shekhawat, SRM Prasanna, Shalendar Bhasin, Ravi Jasuja', 2022, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

This uses channel subtraction, thresholding, compact (hand) criteria, and Kalman filter to detect and track the gesture object to form the gesture trajectory (accuracy of ∼96 %; mAP – 0.9419).

The existing dynamic equation where storage in a catchment is defined as a function of only runoff is modified by introduction of a time lag parameter, which simplifies the equation to an explicit form. The method uses adjusted runoff (product of a coefficient and runoff) as a variable with accumulated storage with a time lag to establish a rainfall-runoff relationship. The performance of the model is tested on short-term rainfall and runoff data of two Indian catchments, and published data of Wills Creek and Shoal Creek. The coefficient of determination R 2 for the plot of runoff (QD) versus Storage S (t-τ) ranges from 0.83 to 0.975. The coefficient of the present non linear model defines against the storm magnitude and the R 2 value reaches up to 0.72.

This potential difference in the sheath layer pulls out ions from the plasma and accelerates them to higher energies in a very short time and lengthscale [3]. Evidently the most crucial role in this entire process is played by the ‘hot’electrons, which depends mainly on the efficient coupling of laser energy in to the plasma.

(11520, 'Background The acoustic world is variable and messy. Signals that allow listeners to identify and/or disambiguate important auditory objects (an unusual rustle of leaves in a darkening forest, your winning bingo number) will likely share many acoustic characteristics with other sounds in the environment. What is more, the most diagnostic auditory dimensions for detecting the ominously rustling leaves or categorizing a crucial syllable may be obscured, distorted, or missing. Just as often, the diagnostic acoustic dimensions may change completely across contexts. These challenges are ubiquitous in speech comprehension. People talk with different accents, different speaking rates, different vocal tracts, and often at the same time. A talker may turn away from you in the middle of a conversation, and then decide to whisper the most intriguing part of their sentence, so as not to be overheard by the person they are talking about. Or, worse yet, the talker may imitate the very different and distinct voice of the object of conversation. Each of these cases dramatically changes the character, usefulness, and significance of the acoustic dimensions available for speech comprehension. This variability and context-dependence in the mapping between acoustic dimensions and the identity or significance of a sound segment means that an\'acoustical fingerprint\'computational approach that has been so successful in recognizing recorded music even in degraded recordings and noisy backgrounds (Wang, 2003) may not be very successful for humans or machines trying to perceive and understand natural speech in everyday environments.', 'Dimension-based Attention in Learning and Understanding Spoken Language', 'Journal', 'Sciences', 'Dimension-based Attention in Learning and Understanding Spoken Language FK Dick, LL Holt, H Nusbaum, N Sharma… - Sciences, 2018 All 3 versions', 'nan', 'Frederic K Dick, Lori L Holt, Howard Nusbaum, Neeraj Sharma, Barbara Shinn-Cunningham', 2018, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Heavy metals that cause severe damage to human health are not biodegradable and hence it is important that they should be removed before effluent disposal. The major sources of effluent containing heavy metals are industries viz. Chloro-alkali, pulp & paper, battery, fertilizer, mining & combustion and rubber processing. Separation of heavy metals by liquid membrane (LM) is one of the most promising separation technologies. The LM is a homogeneous, thin film of liquid (membrane phase) interposed between two other liquid phases, viz. feed (or source) phase and receiving (or strip) phase. The transport of solute across the LM occurs due to its higher solubility and diffusivity in the liquid film as well as the concentration gradients in the phases. In LM based separation the primary issue is selection of suitable solvent (for membrane phase). Most of the conventional organic solvents widely used for the heavy metals extraction processes are toxic, flammable and volatile in nature. So, heavy metals from the industrial effluent need to be separated by green technology. The performance of LM based separation process is affected by various physical and chemical parameters viz. pH, concentration, stirring rate of the aqueous phases, temperature and carrier concentration.

In this manuscript, we propose to use the weighted least squares estimators (WLSEs) of the parameters that are unknown in presence of additive white noise.

Unfortunately, the uncertainty in the model control variable which includes model parameters, initial and boundary conditions, propagates through the model, resulting in the degradation of streamflow forecast. Various studies in the past have shown the potential of soil moisture assimilation in hydrological models resulting in the improved forecast. Further, the efficiency of assimilation is based on the number and the distribution of observations used. This study proposes a new approach called Forward sensitivity method (FSM), which operates in two phases. By running the model and forecast sensitivity dynamics forward in time, the first phase places the observations at or near where the square of the forecast sensitivity with respect to the control takes maximum values. Then using only this subset of observations, the second phase estimates the unknown elements of the control by solving a resulting weighted least squares problem. The power of this approach is demonstrated by assimilating ASCAT soil moisture observations into a conceptual Two Parameter Model in a medium sized watershed lying in the Krishna River Basin, India. The model run extends for four monsoon years from June 2007 to June 2011 and two assimilation scenarios were tested. The first scenario uses all the observations, whereas, the second uses only sensitive observations during assimilation and the results were then compared against open loop simulation (model run without assimilation).

This problem is examined by using Saltzman’s spectral model of convection that admits both chaotic and nonchaotic regimes and is controlled by two parameters—Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. The problem is simplified by stripping the seven-variable constraint to a three-variable constraint. Since emphasis is placed on observation positioning to avoid cost-function flatness, forecast sensitivity to controls is needed. Four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) is silent on this issue of observation placement while Forecast Sensitivity Method (FSM) delivers sensitivities used in placement. With knowledge of the temporal forecast sensitivity matrix V, derivatives of the forecast variables to controls, the cost function can be expressed as a function of the observability Gramian VTV using first-order Taylor series expansion. The goal is to locate observations at places that force the Gramian positive definite. Further, locations are chosen such that the condition number of VTV is small and this guarantees convexity in the vicinity of the cost function minimum. Four numerical experiments are executed, and results are compared with the structure of the cost function independently determined though arduous computation over a wide range of the two nondimensional numbers.

The theme of the work is use of a low-order mixed-layer model that is faithful to the phenomenon in the context of dynamic data assimilation. Data assimilation experiments in the identical-twin mode determine the best place to make observations that minimize the forecast error through adjustment of model controls. The emphasized controls are those associated with the fluxes of heat and moisture from sea to atmosphere. Results indicate that the best observations are at that time and place when the outflowing continental air passes over the warmest sea surface temperatures. In the case studied, this warmest zone is directly over the Loop Current. Observations at times long after the modified air leaves these warmest waters lead to relatively poor control adjustments and little improvement in the forecast. If input to data assimilation is restricted to observations of a single model variable over short intervals of time (the order of several hours), results are relatively poor.

(11685, 'Improving the accuracy of regional aerosol climate impact assessment calls for improvement in the accuracy of regional aerosol radiative effect (ARE) estimation. One of the most important means of achieving this is to use spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets of critical aerosol properties, such as spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA), which are the most important parameters for estimating aerosol radiative effects. However, observations do not provide the above; the space-borne observations though provide wide spatial coverage, are temporal snapshots and suffer from possible sensor degradation over extended periods. On the other hand, the ground-based measurements provide more accurate and temporally continuous data but are spatially near-point observations. Realizing the need for spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets on one hand and the near non-existence of such data over the south Asian region (which is one of the regions where aerosols show large heterogeneity in most of their properties), construction of accurate gridded aerosol products by synthesizing the long-term space-borne and ground-based data has been taken up as an important objective of the South West Asian Aerosol Monsoon Interactions (SWAAMI), a joint Indo-UK field campaign, aiming at characterizing aerosol–monsoon links and their variabilities over the Indian region. In Part 1 of this two-part paper, we present spatially homogeneous gridded datasets of AOD and absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD), generated for the first time over this region.

By way of illustrating the power of these models, he singled out an LOM (7) and presented a very preliminary account of its numerical solution starting from one initial condition and for two values of the Rayleigh number, λ= 2 and 5. This paper provides a complete mathematical characterization of the solution of this LOM (7), herein called the Saltzman LOM (7)[S-LOM (7)].

While the theory of cultural evolution was soon jettisoned, Tylor’s definition has been broadly retained by much of 20th-century anthropology.

However, its iterative interference cancellation algorithm will suffer from performance loss especially under severely fading channels with long delays and has difficulty supporting high-order modulations like 256 QAM, which may not accommodate the emerging ultra-high definition television service. To solve this problem, a channel estimation method for OFDM under the framework of compressive sensing (CS) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, by exploiting the signal structure of recently proposed time-frequency training OFDM scheme, the auxiliary channel information is obtained. Secondly, we propose the auxiliary information based subspace pursuit (A-SP) algorithm to utilize a very small amount of frequency domain pilots embedded in the OFDM block for the exact channel estimation. Moreover, the obtained auxiliary channel information is adopted to reduce the complexity of the classical SP algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the CS-based OFDM outperforms the conventional dual pseudo noise padded OFDM and CS-based TDS-OFDM schemes in both static and mobile environments, especially when the channel length is close to or even larger than the guard interval length, where the conventional schemes fail to work completely.', 'An approach for grammatical constructs of Sanskrit language using morpheme and parts-of-speech tagging by Sanskrit corpus', '', '', 'Compressive Sensing for OFDM Systems Based Channel Estimation under Long Delay Channels SP Singh, R Pandey Related articles', 'nan', 'Shail Prakash Singh, Rashmi Pandey', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The DC-bus capacitor voltage unbalancing is created due to irregular charging and discharging of the capacitor which is originated by asymmetric connections produced by power semiconductor devices in the converter. The capacitor voltage unbalancing has become a burning issue and has invited an intensive research to address this problem in multilevel inverters. The key aspect in the behavior of multilevel rectifiers is to avoid the unbalance in DC-bus capacitor voltages. In the proposed work, a linear controller is used to control the total DC-bus voltage in a similar fashion as in twolevel PWM rectifiers. A non-linear controller is proposed to achieve the balancing of the DC-bus capacitor voltages. In fact, the mechanism which generates the DC-bus capacitor voltage unbalancing is studied and is used to develop the proposed control algorithm.

Intelligent water drop algorithm is a swarm-based nature-inspired optimization algorithm, which has been inspired from natural rivers. A natural river often finds good paths among lots of possible paths in its ways from source to destination and finally find almost optimal path to their destination. These ideas are embedded into the proposed algorithm for solving economic load dispatch problem.

We conclude that robust approaches can be considered as a viable alternative to the Markowitz model, not only in simulated data but also in a real market setup, involving the Indian indices of S&P BSE 30 and S&P BSE 100. Finally, we offer qualitative and quantitative justification regarding the practical usefulness of robust optimization approaches from the point of view of number of stocks, sample size and types of data.', 'Can Robust Optimization Offer Improved Portfolio Performance?

These were quantified by the consideration of four different metrics, namely, reproduction rate, growth rate, doubling time and death to recovery ratio. The incidence data of the COVID-19 (during the period of 2nd March 2020 to 31st May 2020) outbreak in India was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve, making use of the exponential growth, the maximum likelihood estimation, sequential Bayesian method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction. The best fit (based on the data considered) was for the time-dependent approach. Accordingly, this approach was used to assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate. The period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3, saw a reduction in the rate of effective reproduction rate. During the same period the growth rate reduced from during the pre-lockdown to after lockdown 3, accompanied by the average doubling time increasing form - days to - days. Finally, the death-to-recovery ratio dropped from (pre-lockdown) to after lockdown 3. In conclusion, all the four metrics considered to assess the effectiveness of the lockdown, exhibited significant favourable changes, from the pre-lockdown period to the end of lockdown 3.

In addition, for constructing the codebook, we consider features that are derived by incorporating a so called ‘gap parameter’that captures characteristics of sample points in the neighborhood of the point under consideration. We formulate our strategy in a way that, for a given …', 'An improved online writer identification framework using codebook descriptors', 'Journal', 'Pattern Recognition', 'An improved online writer identification framework using codebook descriptors V Venugopal, S Sundaram - Pattern Recognition, 2018 Cited by 20 Related articles All 3 versions', 'Pergamon', 'Vivek Venugopal, Suresh Sundaram', 2018, 5, 2, 5, 6, 2, 0, 20),
(11934, 'An online handwriting recognition (HR) system is usually developed considering point-based features that describe different geometric attributes of handwriting. Often, due to the wide variations in writing styles, the use of point-based features results in high intra-class variability in feature space. To address this problem, we propose a set of features based on character class-conditional probabilities (posterior features) derived from Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for online HR task. The proposed features capture class dependent characteristics with a probabilistic framework, which in turn aid in minimizing the intra-class variability of the feature space. Also, the features well represent the inter-class variability of the feature space for a given classification task. The efficacy of the proposed GMM posterior features is shown for character and word recognition tasks, employing support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

(11935, 'This paper proposes a system to identify the authorship of online handwritten documents. We represent the trace of handwriting of a writer with descriptors that are derived from a set of dictionary atoms obtained in a sparse coding framework. The descriptors for each dictionary atom encode the error while using it alone for reconstruction. The use of sparse representation offers flexibility in describing each of the segmented handwritten sub-strokes of a writer as a combination of more than one atom or prototype. The descriptor is constructed by considering the attributes obtained from sets of histograms extracted at a sub-stroke level. In addition, an entropy-based analysis for the bin size to be used for obtaining the feature sets is proposed. The writer descriptor is evaluated on the paragraph and individual text lines of two publicly available English databases (the IAM and IBM-UB1) and a Chinese database-CASIA.

(11938, 'The challenge of segmenting online handwritten Tamil words has hardly been investigated. In this paper, we report a neuroscience-inspired, lexicon-free approach to segment Tamil words into its constituent symbols (recognizable entities). Based on a simple dominant overlap criterion, the word is grossly segmented into candidate symbols (stroke groups). However, this segmentation is not fully reliable because of varying writing styles resulting in varying levels of overlap. Taking cues from vertebrate visual perception, we utilize both feature based attention and feedback from the classifier to detect possible wrong segmentations. This attention-feedback segmentation (AFS) strategy splits or merges the stroke groups to correct the segmentation errors and forms valid symbols. This maiden attempt on segmentation is tested on 10000 handwritten words collected from hundreds of writers. The efficacy of AFS in segmentation and improving the recognition performance of the handwriting system is amply demonstrated. Our results show a segmentation accuracy of over 99% at symbol level.', 'Neuroscience inspired segmentation of handwritten words', '', '', 'Neuroscience inspired segmentation of handwritten words AG Ramakrishnan, S Sundaram Related articles All 6 versions', 'nan', 'AG Ramakrishnan, Suresh Sundaram', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
