VQA with Cascade of Self-and Co-Attention Blocks,"Aakansha Mishra, Ashish Anand, Prithwijit Guha",2023/2/28,arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.14777,,,,"The use of complex attention modules has improved the performance of the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. This work aims to learn an improved multi-modal representation through dense interaction of visual and textual modalities. The proposed model has an attention block containing both self-attention and co-attention on image and text. The self-attention modules provide the contextual information of objects (for an image) and words (for a question) that are crucial for inferring an answer. On the other hand, co-attention aids the interaction of image and text. Further, fine-grained information is obtained from two modalities by using a Cascade of Self- and Co-Attention blocks (CSCA). This proposal is benchmarked on the widely used VQA2.0 and TDIUC datasets. The efficacy of key components of the model and cascading of attention modules are demonstrated by experiments involving ablation analysis.",0,"VQA with Cascade of Self-and Co-Attention Blocks

Overlapped Speech Detection Using AM-FM Based Time-Frequency Representations,"Shikha Baghel, SRM Prasanna, Prithwijit Guha",2022/11/10,,,,Springer International Publishing,"Overlapped speech contains simultaneous speech of multiple speakers. The presence of overlapped speech is one of the main sources of error for speaker diarization, speech, and speaker recognition systems. Most of the existing works used magnitude spectrum based features for overlap detection. This work focuses on detecting overlapped speech by exploring instantaneous phase and amplitude information of speech signal. Phase characteristics are captured by the Instantaneous Frequency Spectrogram (IFSpec), while Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TEO) based pyknograms are used for representing instantaneous amplitude. Features are learned from the IF spectrogram and TEO-based pyknogram automatically using Fully-Convolutional Neural Network (F-CNN).

Speech and music spectrograms exhibit characteristic harmonic striations that can be used as a feature for detecting their overlap. Hence, this work proposes two features generated using a spectral peak tracking algorithm to capture prominent harmonic patterns in spectrograms. One feature consists of the spectral peak amplitude evolutions in an audio interval. The second feature is designed as a Mel-scaled spectrogram obtained by suppressing non-peak spectral components. In addition, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network architecture is proposed to learn the temporal evolution of spectral peaks. Mel-spectrogram is used as a baseline feature to compare performances. A popular public dataset MUSAN with 102 h of data has been used to perform experiments.

Only overlay text: novel features for TV news broadcast video segmentation,"Raghvendra Kannao, Prithwijit Guha, Bidyut B Chaudhuri",2022/9,Multimedia Tools and Applications,81,21,Springer US,"Segmentation of television news videos into programs and stories (after removing advertisements) is a necessary first step for news broadcast analysis. Existing methods have used manually defined presentation styles as an important feature for such segmentation. Manually defined presentation styles make algorithms channel specific and hampers scalability for large number of channels. In this work, we advocate the usebility of overlay text for automatic characterization of broadcast presentation styles. This automatic characterization will minimize the manual intervention required in developing the scalable solutions for television news broadcast segmentation.

Facial Keypoint Sequence Generation from Audio,"Prateek Manocha, Prithwijit Guha",2020/11/2,arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.01114,,,,"Whenever we speak, our voice is accompanied by facial movements and expressions. Several recent works have shown the synthesis of highly photo-realistic videos of talking faces, but they either require a source video to drive the target face or only generate videos with a fixed head pose. This lack of facial movement is because most of these works focus on the lip movement in sync with the audio while assuming the remaining facial keypoints' fixed nature. To address this, a unique audio-keypoint dataset of over 150,000 videos at 224p and 25fps is introduced that relates the facial keypoint movement for the given audio. This dataset is then further used to train the model, Audio2Keypoint, a novel approach for synthesizing facial keypoint movement to go with the audio. Given a single image of the target person and an audio sequence (in any language), Audio2Keypoint generates a plausible keypoint movement sequence in sync with the input audio, conditioned on the input image to preserve the target person's facial characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes an audio-keypoint dataset and learns a model to output the plausible keypoint sequence to go with audio of any arbitrary length. Audio2Keypoint generalizes across unseen people with a different facial structure allowing us to generate the sequence with the voice from any source or even synthetic voices. Instead of learning a direct mapping from audio to video domain, this work aims to learn the audio-keypoint mapping that allows for in-plane and out-of-plane head rotations, while preserving the person's identity using a Pose Invariant (PIV) Encoder.",0,"Facial Keypoint Sequence Generation from Audio

Classification of speech vs. Speech with background music,"Mrinmoy Bhattacharjee, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Prithwijit Guha",2020/7/19,,,,IEEE,Applications that perform enhancement of speech containing background music require a critical preprocessing step that can efficiently detect such segments. This work proposes such a preprocessing method to detect speech with background music that is mixed at different SNR levels. A bag-of-words approach is proposed in this work. Representative dictionaries from speech and music data are first learned. The signals are processed as spectrograms of 1s intervals. Rows of these spectrograms are used to learn separate speech and music dictionaries. This work proposes a weighting scheme to reduce confusion by suppressing codewords of one class that have similarities to the other class. The proposed feature is a weighted histogram of 1s audio intervals obtained from the learned dictionaries. The classification is performed using a deep neural network classifier.

In this paper, we use a Local Success Weighted Ensemble of SVMs (LSWE-SVM) for advertisement detection. The LSWE-SVM ensures the diversity in errors of component SVMs by training them on individual features with different similarity measures (kernels). The weight of each SVM is determined by an instance dependent “success prediction function”.

Introductory versions of both these approaches had their own weaknesses due to the main challenges of tracking like illumination variations, abrupt motions, deformations/articulations and occlusions. Both these approaches have developed independently with a number of follow-ups in the literature and even the matured versions were never integrated.

A novel local success weighted ensemble classifier,"Raghvendra Kannao, Prithwijit Guha",2015/11/3,,,,IEEE,"Ensemble methods aggregate the decisions of diverse component classifiers to achieve superior classification performances. Most of the previous ensemble frameworks have used fixed weights to determine the influence of each of the component classifiers on the ensemble decision. However, in practice base classifiers usually have expertise in local regions of the feature space. This paper presents a novel framework for instance dependent weighing of base classifiers instead of fixed weights. These classifier weighing functions are linked to the ability of the respective classifiers to correctly predict the labels. For a particular test pattern, base classifiers with higher likelihood of predicting the correct label have higher weights. Thus, weighing functions curb (by having lower weights) the redundant false decisions responsible for mis-classification.

The pedestrians are located in each frame using a standard human detector, which are then tracked in subsequent frames. This is a challenging problem as one has to deal with complex situations like changing background, partial or full occlusion and camera motion. In order to carry out successful tracking, it is necessary to resolve associations between the detected windows in the current frame with those obtained from the previous frame. Compared to methods that use temporal windows incorporating past as well as future information, we attempt to make decision on a frame-by-frame basis.

We designate the resulting qualitative formalism as Oc-7, and show how these occlusion states can be detected and used effectively for the task of multi-object tracking under occlusion of various types.

OCS-14: You can get occluded in fourteen ways,"Prithwijit Guha, Amitabha Mukerjee, KS Venkatesh",2011/6/28,,,,,"Occlusions are a central phenomenon in multiobject computer vision. However, formal analyses (LOS14, ROC20) proposed in the spatial reasoning literature ignore many distinctions crucial to computer vision, as a result of which these algebras have been largely ignored in vision applications. Two distinctions of relevance to visual computation are (a) whether the occluder is a moving object or part of the static background, and (b) whether the visible part of an object is a connected blob or fragmented. In this work, we develop a formal model of occlusion states that combines these criteria with overlap distinctions modeled in spatial reasoning to come up with a comprehensive set of fourteen occlusion states, which we define as OCS14. Transitions between these occlusion states are an important source of information on visual activity (eg splits and merges). We show that the resulting formalism is representationally complete in the sense that these states constitute a partition of all possible occlusion situations based on these criteria. Finally, we show results from implementations of this approach in a test application involving static camera based scene analysis, where occlusion state analysis and multiple object tracking can be used for two tasks–(a) identifying static occluders, and (b) modeling a class of interactions represented as transitions of occlusion states. Thus, the formalism is shown to have direct relevance to actual vision applications.",22,"OCS-14: You can get occluded in fourteen ways

Recent works in the lines of activity “discovery” have proposed the use of probabilistic suffix trees (PST) and its variants which learn the activity models from temporally ordered sequences of object states. Such sequences often contain lots of object-state self-transitions resulting in a large number of PST nodes in the learned activity models. We propose an alternative method of mining these sequences by avoiding to learn the self-transitions while maintaining the useful statistical properties of the sequences thereby forming a “compressed suffix tree” (CST).

We propose a reasoning scheme that binds face localization (motion and mean-shift) and detection (Ada-Boost with Haar features) for tracking multiple faces in image sequences. The reasoning procedure identifies the cases of face isolation (unoccluded), grouping/occlusions, detection/tracking failure, entry/exit and reappearance of faces. Instantiation of these cases are used as cues in selective update of the facial features. Additionally, we maintain a Normalized Face Cluster Set (NFCS) to capture the appearance modes for varying facial poses. These cluster sets are further used in discriminating new faces from the existing ones while restoring the tracks of the later.

In this work, we consider integrating agent behaviors with shape for the purpose of agent discovery. Improved algorithms for video segmentation and tracking under occlusion enable us to construct models that characterize agents in terms of motion and interaction with other objects. We present a preliminary approach for discovering agents based on a combination of appearance and motion histories. Using uncalibrated camera images, we characterize objects discovered in the scene by their shape and motion attributes, and cluster these using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Even with very simple feature …",2,"Spatio-temporal discovery: Appearance+ behavior= agent

Surveillance video mining,"Prithwijit Guha, Arindam Biswas, Amitabha Mukerjee, P Sateesh, KS Venkatesh",2006/1/1,,,,IET Digital Library,"This paper approaches the problem of surveillance event characterization at two levels. First, the information characterizable at the single camera image-plane level, where we use a set of occlusion primitives to define a set of time-varying predicates on heterogeneous objects moving in unknown environments. After learning the scene background online, tracking data generates overlapping agent trajectories. Agent appearance and trajectories are clustered to discover both agent and object categories. Second, the information characterizable at the 3D scene ground-plane level, where scene priors (such as object names) and camera calibration information is used to index and retrieve the event characterizations. The proposed approach does not assume any shape or other priors, and names are assigned a posteriori. Results are presented from a traffic video which can answer queries such as which motorcycles …",5,"Surveillance video mining

Appearance based multiple agent tracking under complex occlusions,"Prithwijit Guha, Amitabha Mukerjee, KS Venkatesh",2006,,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"Agents entering the field of view can undergo two different forms of occlusions, either caused by crowding or due to obstructions by background objects at finite distances from the camera. This work aims at identifying the nature of occlusions encountered in multi-agent tracking by using a set of qualitative primitives derived on the basis of the Persistence Hypothesis – objects continue to exist even when hidden from view. We construct predicates describing a comprehensive set of possible occlusion primitives including entry/exit, partial or complete occlusions by background objects, crowding and algorithm failures resulting from track loss. Instantiation of these primitives followed by selective agent feature updates enables us to develop an effective scheme for tracking multiple agents in relatively unconstrained environments. The agents are primarily detected as foreground blobs and are characterized by …",10,"Appearance based multiple agent tracking under complex occlusions

A multiscale co-linearity statistic based approach to robust background modeling,"Prithwijit Guha, Dibyendu Palai, KS Venkatesh, Amitabha Mukerjee",2006,,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"Background subtraction is an essential task in several static camera based computer vision systems. Background modeling is often challenged by spatio-temporal changes occurring due to local motion and/or variations in illumination conditions. The background model is learned from an image sequence in a number of stages, viz. preprocessing, pixel/region feature extraction and statistical modeling of feature distribution. A number of algorithms, mainly focusing on feature extraction and statistical modeling have been proposed to handle the problems and comparatively little exploration has occurred at the preprocessing stage. Motivated by the fact that disturbances caused by local motions disappear at lower resolutions, we propose to represent the images at multiple scales in the preprocessing stage to learn a pyramid of background models at different resolutions. During operation, foreground pixels are …",12,"A multiscale co-linearity statistic based approach to robust background modeling

Intrusion detection and tracking with pan-tilt cameras,"Arindam Biswas, Prithwijit Guha, Amitabha Mukerjee, KS Venkatesh",2006/1/1,,,,IET Digital Library,"The use of autonomous pan-tilt cameras as opposed to static cameras can dramatically enhance the range and effectiveness of surveillance systems, but effective tracking in such pan-tilt scenarios remains a challenge. Existing approaches for constructing mosaiced background models require accurate camera motion parameters, and online updates for the background model in the presence of scene activity, as well as real-time tracking of targets in the presence of partial occlusions have not been solved. In this paper we propose a model that requires no camera motion parameters, the background is learned online, and the solution is integrated with target tracking. Camera egomotion is estimated as the dominant cluster mean for a mixture of Gaussians learned over point correlations between consecutive frames. Putative target regions are detected as changes over the learned background model GMM mosaic. In …",22,"Intrusion detection and tracking with pan-tilt cameras

Efficient occlusion handling for multiple agent tracking by reasoning with surveillance event primitives,"Prithwijit Guha, Amitabha Mukerjee, KS Venkatesh",2005/10/15,,,,IEEE,"Tracking multiple agents in a monocular visual surveillance system is often challenged by the phenomenon of occlusions. Agents entering the field of view can undergo two different forms of occlusions, either caused by crowding or due to obstructions by background objects at finite distances from the camera. The agents are primarily detected as foreground blobs and are characterized by their motion history and weighted color histograms. These features are further used for localizing them in subsequent frames through motion prediction assisted mean shift tracking. A number of Boolean predicates are evaluated based on the fractional overlaps between the localized regions and foreground blobs. We construct predicates describing a comprehensive set of possible surveillance event primitives including entry/exit, partial or complete occlusions by background objects, crowding, splitting of agents and algorithm …",34,"Efficient occlusion handling for multiple agent tracking by reasoning with surveillance event primitives

DynaTracker: Target tracking in active video surveillance systems,"Prithwijit Guha, Dibyendu Palai, Dip Goswami, Amitabha Mukerjee",2005/7/18,,,,IEEE,"Active video surveillance systems provide challenging research issues in the interface of computer vision, pattern recognition and control system analysis. A significant part of such systems is devoted toward active camera control for efficient target tracking. DynaTracker is a pan-tilt device based active camera system for maintaining continuous track of the moving target, while keeping the same at a pre-specified region (typically, the center) of the image. The significant contributions in this work are the use of mean-shift algorithm for visual tracking and the derivation of the error dynamics for a proportional-integral control action. The stability analysis and optimal controller gain selections are performed from the simulation studies of the derived error dynamics. Simulation predictions are also validated from the results of practical experimentations.

Hybrid hierarchical learning from dynamic scenes,"Prithwijit Guha, Pradeep Vaghela, Pabitra Mitra, KS Venkatesh, Amitabha Mukerjee",2005,,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"The work proposes a hierarchical architecture for learning from dynamic scenes at various levels of knowledge abstraction. The raw visual information is processed at different stages to generate hybrid symbolic/sub-symbolic descriptions of the scene, agents and events. The background is incrementally learned at the lowest layer, which is used further in the mid-level for multi-agent tracking with symbolic reasoning. The agent/event discovery is performed at the next higher layer by processing the agent features, status history and trajectory. Unlike existing vision systems, the proposed algorithm does not assume any prior information and aims at learning the scene/agent/event models from the acquired images. This makes it a versatile vision system capable of performing in a wide variety of environments.",0,"Hybrid hierarchical learning from dynamic scenes

These three subsystems create a virtual reality environment using which the operator can operate the slave form a distant location, and also get force and visual information from the slave environment. The exoskeleton was worn by the operator and its position sensors were used to get the angular information about the motion of the operators arm. Kinesthetic force feedback was obtained by converting the force/torque at the slave side sensor to corresponding EMG signals and then applying it to the operators arm by FES. A vision subsystem was used to obtain the position coordinates of the operator in the work cell. The developed telemanipulator is more ergonomic, cheaper and more efficient than the conventional telemanipulators used today.",0,"Development of an Advanced Telemanipulator Using an

A cost-effective multiple camera vision system using FireWire cameras and software synchronization,"Piyush Kumar Rai, Kamal Tiwari, Prithwijit Guha, Amitabha Mukerjee",2003/12/17,"Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing, Hyderabad, India",1720,,,"We describe a cost-effective multiple-camera computer-vision system using low cost simple FireWire web cameras. The FireWire cameras, like other FireWire devices operate on the high speed FireWire bus. Current supported bandwidth is 400 Mbps. Right from its introduction, the FireWire (synonymously known as IEEE 1394) bus interface specification has proven its capabilities and has been supported by both developers and users. Due to its low cost and ease in connectivity, FireWire has been recommended as the technology to be used in machine-vision systems and image-processing applications. We have developed a multiple-camera synchronized computer vision system using FireWire cameras. The synchronization has been achieved using Software Triggering which has been discussed in the paper. Possible applications of such a system have also been discussed in the paper. Our system does away with the need of costly cameras and frame-grabber cards which are generally used in conventional multiplecamera systems. The direct pixel-to-data correspondence without the need of a frame grabber or classic synchronization systems (requiring hardware synchronization mechanisms) justifies the novelty of such a system. Calibration of the multiple camera system has also been discussed.",27,"A cost-effective multiple camera vision system using FireWire cameras and software synchronization

The computation of the load scheduling decisions takes a longer time for large systems. In such cases, the artificial neural networks (ANN) can be applied quite effectively to the problem of economic load scheduling. In this paper, a simple system constituting three thermal units is considered first and then two relatively larger systems are taken to study whether there would be any significant change when dealing with larger systems or not. An extensive study is presented on simulation, training and performance of the different types of ANN.

Classification of rolled bloom by artificial neural networks,"M Gopala Krishna, Prithwijit Guha, BM Karan",2002/3/1,Steel Times International,26,3,Quartz Business Media Ltd,"SAIL's Bhilai blooming mill rolls ingots into rectangular, square and shaped blooms of various cross sectional dimensions for further rolling in the billet mill or Rail & Structural mill (RSM). Altogether, there are six types of sections rolled depending upon the width and height of bloom. A knowledge of the width and height of bloom helps identify the type of section rolled in a particular campaign. Once the type of section to be rolled is identified, the corresponding bloom volume required for that section is determined from tables stored in computer memory. Knowing the desired bloom volume and cross sectional dimensions, the appropriate bloom length can be calculated and the bloom cut accordingly to the required volume for the RSM.
