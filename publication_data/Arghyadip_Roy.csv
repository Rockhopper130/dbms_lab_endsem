Beam Switching with Low Control Overhead for Millimeter-wave Communication,"Ashim Kumar, Arghyadip Roy, Ratnajit Bhattacharjee",2022/11/29,,,,IEEE,"Mm-wave communication using massive Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is highly directional in nature, hence making beam scanning and alignment a crucial aspect. In high mobility scenarios, frequent beam scanning may incur a performance degradation due to high control overhead. In this paper, we have adopted a supervised learning approach to determine the precoders and combiners for a hybrid beamforming architecture. To avoid frequent beam scanning and switching, we propose an overhead-aware strategy that addresses a trade-off between the spectral efficiency (SE) and the overhead signalling. Simulations are performed using channel data generated using the open source channel simulator NYUSIM.",0,"Beam Switching with Low Control Overhead for Millimeter-wave Communication

GoPro: a Low Complexity Task Allocation Algorithm for a Mobile Edge Computing System,"Arghyadip Roy, Nilanjan Biswas",2022/5/24,,,,IEEE,"In an Internet of Things (IoT) based network, tasks arriving at individual nodes can be processed in-device or at a local Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server. In this paper, we focus on the optimal resource allocation problem for tasks arriving in an MEC based IoT network. To address the inherent trade-off between the computation time and the power consumption, we aim to minimize the average power consumption subject to a constraint on the deadline violation probability. The problem is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problem. To address the high complexities of achieving optimality, we propose a low-complexity heuristic task scheduling scheme. Efficacy of our approach is demonstrated using simulations.",0,"GoPro: a Low Complexity Task Allocation Algorithm for a Mobile Edge Computing System

A Policy Gradient Algorithm for the Risk-Sensitive Exponential Cost MDP,"Mehrdad Moharrami, Yashaswini Murthy, Arghyadip Roy, Rayadurgam Srikant",2022/2/8,arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.04157,,,,"We study the risk-sensitive exponential cost MDP formulation and develop a trajectory-based gradient algorithm to find the stationary point of the cost associated with a set of parameterized policies. We derive a formula that can be used to compute the policy gradient from (state, action, cost) information collected from sample paths of the MDP for each fixed parameterized policy. Unlike the traditional average-cost problem, standard stochastic approximation theory cannot be used to exploit this formula. To address the issue, we introduce a truncated and smooth version of the risk-sensitive cost and show that this new cost criterion can be used to approximate the risk-sensitive cost and its gradient uniformly under some mild assumptions. We then develop a trajectory-based gradient algorithm to minimize the smooth truncated estimation of the risk-sensitive cost and derive conditions under which a sequence of truncations can be used to solve the original, untruncated cost problem.",3,"A Policy Gradient Algorithm for the Risk-Sensitive Exponential Cost MDP

Online reinforcement learning of optimal threshold policies for Markov decision processes,"Arghyadip Roy, Vivek Borkar, Abhay Karandikar, Prasanna Chaporkar",2021/8/27,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,67,7,IEEE,"To overcome the curses of dimensionality and modeling of dynamic programming methods to solve Markov decision process problems, reinforcement learning (RL) methods are adopted in practice. Contrary to traditional RL algorithms, which do not consider the structural properties of the optimal policy, we propose a structure-aware learning algorithm to exploit the ordered multithreshold structure of the optimal policy, if any. We prove the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal policy.

Online radio access technology selection algorithms in a 5g multi-rat network,"Arghyadip Roy, Prasanna Chaporkar, Abhay Karandikar, Pranav Jha",2021/7/14,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,,,IEEE,"In todays wireless networks, a variety of Radio Access Technologies (RATs) are present. However, each RAT being controlled individually leads to suboptimal utilization of network resources. Due to the remarkable growth of data traffic, interworking among different RATs is becoming necessary to overcome the problem of suboptimal resource utilization. Users can be offloaded from one RAT to another based on loads of different networks, channel conditions and priority of users. We consider the optimal RAT selection problem in a Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR)-Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) network where we aim to maximize the total system throughput subject to constraints on the blocking probability of high priority users and the offloading probability of low priority users.

Adaptive KL-UCB based Bandit Algorithms for Markovian and iid Settings,"Arghyadip Roy, Sanjay Shakkottai, R Srikant",2020/9/14,arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.06606,,,,"In the regret-based formulation of Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problems, except in rare instances, much of the literature focuses on arms with i.i.d. rewards. In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining regret guarantees for MAB problems in which the rewards of each arm form a Markov chain which may not belong to a single parameter exponential family. To achieve logarithmic regret in such problems is not difficult: a variation of standard Kullback-Leibler Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) does the job. However, the constants obtained from such an analysis are poor for the following reason: i.i.d. rewards are a special case of Markov rewards and it is difficult to design an algorithm that works well independent of whether the underlying model is truly Markovian or i.i.d. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm that identifies whether the rewards from each arm are truly Markovian or i.i.d. using a total variation distance-based test. Our algorithm then switches from using a standard KL-UCB to a specialized version of KL-UCB when it determines that the arm reward is Markovian, thus resulting in low regret for both i.i.d. and Markovian settings.",0,"Adaptive KL-UCB based Bandit Algorithms for Markovian and iid Settings

In DC, a foreground User Equipment (UE) with multiple transceivers has a possibility to connect to a Macro eNodeB (MeNB) and a Small cell eNodeB (SeNB) simultaneously. In downlink split bearer architecture of DC, a data radio bearer at MeNB gets divided into two; one part is forwarded to the SeNB through a non-ideal backhaul link to the UE, and the other part is forwarded by the MeNB. This may lead to an increase in the total delay at the UE since different packets corresponding to a single transmission may incur varying amounts of delays in the two different paths.

Although, the inter-working of IEEE 802.11 WLANs with 3GPP LTE has indicated enhanced network performance in the context of capacity and load balancing, the WLAN discovery scheme implemented in most of the commercially available smartphones is very inefficient and results in high battery drainage. In this paper, we have proposed an energy efficient WLAN discovery scheme for 3GPP LTE and IEEE 802.11 WLAN inter-working scenario. User Equipment (UE), in the proposed scheme, uses 3GPP network assistance along with the results of past channel scans, to optimally select the next channels to scan. Further, we have also developed an algorithm to accurately estimate the UE's mobility state, using 3GPP network signal strength patterns. We have implemented various discovery schemes in Android framework, to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme against other solutions in the literature. Since, Android does not support selective scanning mode, we have implemented modules in Android to enable selective scanning. Further, we have also used simulation studies and justified the results using power consumption modeling.
