A multi-objective worker selection scheme in crowdsourced platforms using NSGA-II,"Akash Yadav, Sumit Mishra, Ashok Singh Sairam",2022/9/1,Expert Systems with Applications,201,,Pergamon,"Crowdsourcing has led to a paradigm shift in how commercial houses execute projects by lowering the production cost. A crucial aspect of crowdsourcing is selecting the best set of workers to perform a task. The environment envisaged in this work is an independent pool of workers, each equipped with a pre-defined set of skills. We assume that these skills do not follow any priority order over each other. Given a task with a set of required skills, we aim to select a team of workers who can collectively fulfil the task’s requirements, while maximizing the collective expertise and minimizing the team cost. We propose a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) based algorithm to find the best set of workers that can perform the task. The basic operators of the evolutionary computation approach are tuned in accordance with our problem objectives.

Ripple: An approach to locate k nearest neighbours for location-based services,"Pratima Biswas, Sourav Kumar Dandapat, Ashok Singh Sairam",2022/3/1,,105,,Pergamon,"The increasing popularity of location-based services has led to a renewed interest in spatial query processing. In this paper, we propose Ripple, a light-weighted framework to find the nearest neighbours. The area is divided into square cells of equal size to form a grid structure. The search advances by progressively expanding the investigation region as a series of concentric squares, with the cell of query point as the centre. This is in contrast to the popular approach of increasing the search space as concentric circles. The circular search scheme explores only those square cells that intersect the circle and as a result, has a smaller search region. However, it has an added overhead of tracing the cells that intersect the circle for the same reason. In Ripple, there is no such additional overhead due to harmony in the investigation region’s configuration and the underlying grid structure. We optimize the search space by …",2,"Ripple: An approach to locate k nearest neighbours for location-based services

Controller placement problem in software‐defined networking: A survey,"Abha Kumari, Ashok Singh Sairam",2021/9,Networks,78,2,"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","A distinctive feature of software‐defined networking (SDN) is a logically centralized control plane realized using multiple physical controllers. The placement of the controllers, the so‐called controller placement problem (CPP), is a crucial design issue. It influences network performance parameters such as latency, flow setup time, network availability, load balance of the controllers, and energy consumption. In this article, we illustrate the formulation of these CPP objectives. We categorize the CPP design solutions as either static or adaptive. In adaptive CPP, the solutions proposed dynamically adapt to the number of controllers required and the switch to controller mapping to varying network traffic. We further differentiate adaptive CPP as wired or wireless.

A Budget and Deadline Aware Task Assignment Scheme for Crowdsourcing Environment,"Akash Yadav, Joydeep Chandra, Ashok Singh Sairam",2021/3/3,IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing,10,2,IEEE,"This article addresses the problem of assigning heterogeneous tasks with multiple skill requirements in crowdsourcing platforms. The aim is to find mutually exclusive, a highly-productive set of workers who can successfully complete the tasks within a given deadline and budget. We propose a timeline based weighted aggregation (TWA) technique to quantify the per-skill score of a worker. The score is computed based on the worker’s profile and past work experiences. Given the worker’s score, we formulate the problem as one of maximizing the productivity of all the given tasks. A two-stage approximation solution is proposed. In the first stage, we offer a greedy-based 2-approximation algorithm for a single task. In the second stage, a local ratio based algorithm is proposed to extend the solution for multiple tasks.

We provide an analytical solution for the expected number of nodes that are discovered as a function of the number of nodes randomly sampled in the graph. We use the concepts of combinatorics, probability, and inclusion–exclusion principle for computing the number of discovered nodes.

Detecting semantic attacks in intelligent transport system,"Ashok Singh Sairam, Arav Garg",2019/9/5,,,,IEEE,"Intelligent Transport System (ITS) rely on cooperation between vehicles to create awareness of surroundings by an exchange of messages. The two standardized messages used in ITS communication are Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) and Decentralized Environment Notification Messages (DENM). A CAM is periodically transmitted by an ITS station to ensure awareness of the surrounding. DENMs are asynchronous messages triggered by events. In this work, we outline the possibility of a semantic attack on DENM messages. In a semantic attack, the messages generated by an ITS-station is manipulated to alter the meaning (semantic) to induce real damage to the transport system. Such attacks are hard to detect as the message syntax itself is legitimate. A dynamic trust model is proposed based on the messages generated by the ITS stations.

A survey of controller placement problem in software defined networks,"Abha Kumari, Ashok Singh Sairam",2019/5/12,,,,,"Software Defined Network (SDN) is an emerging network paradigm which provides a centralized view of the network by decoupling the network control plane from the data plane. This strategy of maintaining a global view of the network optimizes resource management. However, the implementation of SDN using a single physical controller lead to issues of scalability and robustness. A physically distributed but logically centralized SDN controller architecture promises to resolve both these issues. Distributed SDN along with its benefits brings along the problem of the number of controllers required and their placement in the network. This problem is referred to as the controller placement problem (CPP) and this paper is mainly concerned with the CPP solution techniques. The paper formally defines CPP, gives a comprehensive review of the various performance metrics and characteristics of the available CPP solutions.

Due to the alteration in the attack path, the standard traceback procedures proposed in literature fail to construct the attack path.

Inferring the deployment of source address validation filtering using silence of path-backscatter,"Samant Saurabh, Ashok Singh Sairam",2018/2/25,,,,IEEE,"IP source spoofing is a consequence of lack of packet level authentication in the Internet which allows attackers to carry out Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Source address validation filtering is one of the most important scheme that is deployed in the Internet to deter such attacks by filtering the spoofed IP packets. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to study the deployment of source address validation-filtering by using some special path backscatter messages that are generated by the spoofed traffic. We use the long term absence of such messages from an Autonomous System (AS) to classify it as non-spoofer AS. We use Caida's backscatter dataset for our study.

The paper introduces the concept of bounding the solution space of BPSO. The minimum and maximum value of each objective called bound of the solution is computed.

To address the privacy concerns of LBS users, a large number of security approaches have been proposed based on the concept of k-anonymity.

As such these approaches ignore the turnaround time to process a user request, which is crucial for a real-time application like LBS.

Selecting stable route in multipath routing protocols,"Akash Yadav, Ashok Singh Sairam, Arka Prokash Mazumdar",2017/7/3,,,,IEEE,"Link failure due to node mobility is routine in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). A standard approach to deal with such failures is to select stable routes instead of the shortest route. However, protocols that select stable route do not attempt to optimize the number of hops and hence do not guarantee improvement in performance. Another approach to handle mobility induced route failure is multipath reactive protocols. These protocols start forwarding the packet on the first available route and switches path when a route failure is detected. Although these multipath protocols save on route rediscovery overhead, we establish that they still incur a substantial overhead called route handover cost, while switching among the alternate paths.

Since information of a 32-bit field is converted to a 16-bit field, irrespective of the hash function used, collisions occur. This means there will be false positives (that is incorrectly identifying a legitimate user as attacker) and the problem will escalate as the size of the network increase. To avoid such collisions, we propose to explore the feasibility of using packet marks that …",0,"Network Attack Detection and Mitigation

Survey of Bandwidth Estimation Techniques,"Ashok Singh Sairam, Gautam Barua",2015,Wirel. Pers.

End users can use the information to estimate performance of a network path to a given destination. The knowledge of bottlenecks can provide network operators insight into the causes of congestion and ways of circumventing it. Flows that share a common bottleneck resource can benefit from cooperative congestion control strategies ([16]). Due to the intriguing nature of the problem and its practical importance, a number of techniques as well as tools have been proposed to measure bandwidth on Internet paths. In this paper we survey a large number of publicly available tools and techniques to estimate bandwidth in stub networks. We found that although there are some tools available that can be adapted to meet our requirement, these tools do not give consistent performance. We therefore devise a simple strategy that provides an upper bound to the estimation results. Our scheme ensures that the results of these tools do not stray beyond acceptable limits.

In the first stage, the firewall uses early rejection technique to filter out known malicious traffic. In the second stage, the firewall uses segmentation based tree search to optimize the overhead of matching incoming packet.

The scheme is compatible to packet fragmentation and at the same time does not add space overhead. The proposed technique produces low false positive as well as adds very low processing and storage overhead at the edge router. An issue with existing filtering scheme for DoS attacks is that they suffer from heavy collateral damage. Our proposed scheme minimises collateral damage using signature pushback and allows legitimate traffic to be served smoothly. We optimise pushback by using Lamport hash chain and filtering time by sorting the attack feature based on its entropy.

In such networks, a major challenge is to provide seamless connectivity without incurring excessive routing overhead. Routing protocols for ad hoc networks generally select the best possible path based on the current topology. However, these protocols cannot handle mobility induced route failures. A few ad hoc routing protocols have been proposed which select multiple, disjoint path to the destination. These multipath protocols start forwarding packet on the first available route and in case the route fails, it switches over to the next available path. In this way, they save on the route rediscovery overhead, but there is still a substantial overhead in switching among the alternate paths.

In this paper, we first present a mathematical model to compute the total number of packets including duplicate packets generated by OR protocols. We use the model to analyse well-known OR protocols and understand the reason behind their increase in number of transmissions. Next, we propose an OR scheme transmission-aware opportunistic ad hoc routing (TOAR) protocol, which attempts to minimize retransmissions. Our proposed OR protocol uses tree structures to select forwarders and prioritize them. The use of tree structures helps in identifying primary forwarders which carry packets farthest to the destination during each transmission round. TOAR also helps in choosing secondary forwarders which will transmit packets missed out by the forwarder. The optimized selection of forwarders results in significant reduction in retransmissions, a smaller forwarder list set, and improvement in goodput.",12,"TOAR: transmission-aware opportunistic ad hoc routing protocol

A more accurate completion condition for attack-graph reconstruction in Probabilistic Packet Marking algorithm,"Samant Saurabh, Ashok Singh Sairam",2013/2/15,,,,IEEE,"Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM) is one of the most promising scheme for IP Traceback in case of DDoS attack.

Analyzing SQL Meta characters and preventing SQL Injection attacks using meta filter,"Sangita Roy, Avinash Kumar Singh, Ashok Singh Sairam",2011/5/28,"International Conference on Information and Electronics Engineering, ICIEE 2011, IACSIT Press",6,,,SQL injection attacks (SQLIA) are widely used in which an attacker crafts input to the application server to access or modify data on the database server. A common approach for an attacker to launch SQLIA is by modifying the input URL to contain partial SQL queries and trick the server into executing them. In this paper we first identify all those input patterns that can appear in the URL of an attack. Next we proposed to deploy a SQL Meta character filter that parses the input URL to detect attack patterns. The attack patterns are so chosen so that SQL Meta characters that appear in a legal input are not filtered out. We implement the filter using Java servlet and demonstrate its effectiveness.,9,"Analyzing SQL Meta characters and preventing SQL Injection attacks using meta filter

This trend has necessitated the need for a global distributed index for in-network storage in power constrained sensor networks. We propose and evaluate the architecture for such networks and a distributed indexing for the architecture that allows distributed queries to proceed in a fault-tolerant and energy efficient manner with low latency. We discuss the rationale behind the choice of our indexing scheme and evaluate some of the characteristics of the scheme.",0,"Global Distributed Indexing for In-Network Storage in Sensor Networks

Pt: A path tracing and filtering mechanism to defend against ddos attacks,"Samant Saurabh, Ashok Singh Sairam",2011,,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"Distributed Denial of Service Attack continues to plague the world. Defense against the DDoS attacks gets complicated due to IP spoofing. We propose a new packet marking technique PT (called Path Tracer) which imprints the fingerprint of the path taken by attack traffic in each packet, thereby enabling the victim to identify the attack traffic on per packet basis even in presence of IP Spoofing. Our Packet Marking Technique has many unique features. It helps the victim to proactively filter out the attack packets based on the unique path mark. A single packet contains information about complete attack path. The marking algorithm is very simple. Our approach does not create overhead in the packet and it does not require any extra storage. Analysis of our scheme proves the effectiveness of PT in filtering out DDoS traffic while allowing the legitimate traffic to be processed normally.",2,"Pt: A path tracing and filtering mechanism to defend against ddos attacks

Key Validation Using Weighted-Edge Web of Trust Model,"Sumit Kumar, Nahar Singh, Ashok Singh Sairam",2011,,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"Public key cryptography is widely used in the establishment of secure communication. An important issue in the use of public key cryptography is to ensure that a public key actually belongs to its owner. This problem is referred to as the key validation problem. One solution to this key validation problem is the centralized public key infrastructure (PKI) model ([1]). A second alternative is the decentralized Web of Trust model ([2]). In this model a user depends on digital certificate introduced by other users, who may be trustworthy or otherwise, to establish the binding between a public key and its owner. In this work we propose to model the trust relationship between users as weighted edges. We propose an algorithm to find trusted paths and thus validate public keys. The proposed algorithm is simple and has a low complexity both in terms of time and space.",0,"Key Validation Using Weighted-Edge Web of Trust Model

Defeating reflector based denial-of-service attacks using single packet filters,"Ashok Singh Sairam, Late Ashish Subramaniam, Gautam Barua",2010/8/25,,,,IEEE,"Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated with few practical solutions available. In this paper we consider the issue of filtering reflector based DoS attacks and of identifying attackers. For reflector based attacks, a Signature Conflict Triggered Filtering (SCTF) scheme based on Deterministic Edge Router Marking (DERM) was proposed. We suggest an enhancement to make the 3-way handshake in SCTF stateless and call it Fast-SCTF. We then propose a framework using BGP for a single-packet handshake. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is space efficient, more secure, robust and it requires very little cooperation among autonomous systems.",6,"Defeating reflector based denial-of-service attacks using single packet filters

Distributed route control schemes to load balance incoming traffic in multihomed stub networks,"Ashok Singh Sairam, Gautam Barua",2010/1/29,,,,IEEE,"Load balancing traffic of a multihomed stub network among its various egress links can significantly improve performance by allowing the network to route its traffic around congested paths. In, several centralized route control schemes to load balance traffic were proposed. It was shown that employing these route control schemes resulted in significant improvement in round-trip times. We carry this exploration further by developing distributed algorithms to load balance traffic. We show theoretically that the expected performance of the distributed version is the same as the centralized routing scheme. We further validate the schemes using both synthetic as well as actual traffic traces.",5,"Distributed route control schemes to load balance incoming traffic in multihomed stub networks

Load balancing inbound traffic in multihomed stub autonomous systems,"Ashok Singh Sairam, Gautam Barua",2009/1/5,,,,IEEE,"In the Internet, with many competing networks each trying to optimise its own bandwidth, a stub network has limited knowledge about user demands, available network resources and routing policies of other networks. This uncertainty makes the task of interdomain traffic engineering for a stub network very challenging. The basic aim of a stub network connected to multiple ISPs (multihomed) is to load balance its traffic among its various edge links. Our goal in this work is to distribute the incoming traffic of a multihomed stub network among its various edge links. The focus is on networks that primarily download traffic from the Internet. Regulating the incoming traffic is difficult since it will require to influence the behaviour of the remote destinations. We performed a systematic analysis of our problem and showed that even a restricted instance of the problem is NP-complete. We proposed simple, low-cost route control …",3,"Load balancing inbound traffic in multihomed stub autonomous systems

Load Balancing in Multihomed Stub Networks,Ashok Singh Sairam,2009,,,,,"While there has been a steep growth in internet bandwidth, international bandwidth prices have declined sharply. This has led to a trend where large enterprises and educational in stitutes continually increase their Internet bandwidth and subscribe to more than one ISP (multihoming) to increase resilience. Higher speeds will of course mean better performance but beyond a point, the improvement in performance does not match the increase in speed. ....",1,"Load Balancing in Multihomed Stub Networks

Effective bandwidth utilisation in multihoming networks,"Ashok Singh Sairam, Gautam Barua",2006/1/8,,,,IEEE,"In order to bridge the speed disparity at the LAN-WAN interface, enterprises install a number of policy-based devices to enforce administrative policies over the WAN access. The conventional techniques of bandwidth management concentrate only on the outgoing traffic from the local network, since that is the only traffic that can be controlled. However it is usually the incoming traffic that causes bottlenecks. This paper proposes a simple load balancing approach to optimize the use of WAN links in a multihomed environment. Incoming traffic on a link is controlled by diverting outgoing traffic from some nodes to other links. Incoming bandwidth is measured, thresholds are defined, and traffic diversion takes place to maintain the thresholds. We present a scheme to implement this. A prototype implementation has been done on an educational campus network. Preliminary experiments have shown that there are …",3,"Effective bandwidth utilisation in multihoming networks

Bandwidth Management using Load Balancing,"Ashok Singh Sairam, Gautam Barua",2006,,7,,,"WAN interface, enterprises install a number of policy-based devices to enforce administrative policies over the WAN access. The conventional techniques of bandwidth management concentrate only on the outgoing traffic from the local network. Regulating the outgoing traffic is easy given that the user has full control over it. However, controlling the incoming traffic is difficult since the user has no control on the traffic sent by an Internet agent. This paper proposes a simple load balancing approach to optimize the use of WAN links in a multihomed environment. By distributing the user traffic among the various WAN links we try to optimize the utilization of incoming bandwidth on the access links thereby giving an indirect measure to control the incoming traffic. We deploy a prototype implementation of our approach on a campus network with high incoming traffic, to evaluate the performance benefits. Using a large collection of network traces, we find that even with a subnet-level of load balancing there can be significant increase in performance. The proposed load balancing approach can be used as a first step toward controlling the incoming traffic, before other actual bandwidth management techniques are applied.",4,"Bandwidth Management using Load Balancing

Managing Incoming Traffic,Ashok Singh Sairam,,,,,,"In the past few years, Internet access speeds of or-ganizations such as enterprises and educational institutions have improved significantly. However, increase in Internet speed do not necessarily translate into a proportionate increase in download performance if the traffic is not optimally distributed. In this work, we first identified that incoming traffic is the major source of congestion for network with high-content receivers. Secondly, we proposed a simple Load Balancing approach for multi-homed networks to improve Internet performance. A prototype of our scheme was implemented in an educational campus network. Finally, we propose to study our approach by scaling it to a domain network ie OSPF or IS-IS cloud, where the WAN links can be at different geographical location.",0,"Managing Incoming Traffic
