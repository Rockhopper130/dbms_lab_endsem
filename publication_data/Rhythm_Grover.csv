Estimation of the Elementary Chirp Model Parameters,"Anjali Mittal, Rhythm Grover, Debasis Kundu, Amit Mitra",2023/3/8,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,,,IEEE,"In this paper, we propose some estimation techniques to estimate the elementary chirp model parameters, which are encountered in sonar, radar, acoustics, and other areas. We derive asymptotic theoretical properties of least squares estimators and approximate least squares estimators for the one component elementary chirp model. It is proved that the proposed estimators are strongly consistent and follow the normal distribution asymptotically. We also suggest how to obtain proper initial values for these methods. The problem of finding initial values is a difficult problem when the number of components in the model is large, or when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, or when two frequency rates are close to each other.

On estimating parameters of a multi-component Chirp Model with equal chirp rates,"Abhinek Shukla, Debasis Kundu, Amit Mitra, Rhythm Grover",2023/2/23,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,,,IEEE,"Multi-component chirp signal models with equal chirp rates appear in various radar applications, e.g., synthetic aperture radar, echo signal of a rapid mobile target, etc. Many sub-optimal estimators have been developed for such models, however, these suffer from the problem of either identifiability or error propagation effect. In this paper, we have developed theoretical properties of the least squares estimators (LSEs) of the parameters of multi-component chirp model with equal chirp rates, where the model is contaminated with linear stationary errors. We also propose two computationally efficient estimators as alternative to LSEs, namely sequential combined estimators and sequential plugin estimators. Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of these estimators have been derived. Interestingly, it is observed that sequential combined estimator of the chirp rate parameter is asymptotically efficient.

On Weighted Least Squares Estimators of Parameters of a Chirp Model,"Debasis Kundu, Swagata Nandi, Rhythm Grover",2023/1,"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing",42,1,Springer US,"The least squares method seems to be a natural choice in estimating the parameters of a chirp model. But the least squares estimators are very sensitive to the outliers. Even in presence of very few outliers, the performance of the least squares estimators becomes quite unsatisfactory. Due to this reason, the least absolute deviation method has been proposed in the literature. But implementing the least absolute deviation method is quite challenging particularly for the multicomponent chirp model. In this paper, we propose to use the weighted least squares estimators, which seem to be more robust in presence of a few outliers. First, we consider the weighted least squares estimators of the unknown parameters of a single component chirp signal model. It is assumed that the weight function is a finite degree polynomial and the errors are independent and identically distributed random variables with mean zero and …",0,"On Weighted Least Squares Estimators of Parameters of a Chirp Model

Approximate least squares estimators of a two-dimensional chirp model,"Abhinek Shukla, Rhythm Grover, Debasis Kundu, Amit Mitra",2022/11/1,Journal of Multivariate Analysis,192,,Academic Press,"In this paper, we propose a method based on maximizing a periodogram-type function for parameter estimation of a two-dimensional (2-D) mono-component chirp signal model. The obtained estimators are called approximate least squares estimators (ALSEs). We also put forward a sequential algorithm for parameter estimation of a more general version of the model with multiple number of components. The main focus of the paper has been on developing the large-sample properties of the proposed estimators. Derived theoretical results show that the proposed estimators are strongly consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Moreover, it is shown that the derived asymptotic distribution is identical to that of the traditional least squares estimators (LSEs).

A Computationally Efficient algorithm to estimate the Parameters of a Two-Dimensional Chirp Model with the product term,"Abhinek Shukla, Rhythm Grover, Debasis Kundu, Amit Mitra",2022/9/7,arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.02975,,,,"Chirp signal models and their generalizations have been used to model many natural and man-made phenomena in signal processing and time series literature. In recent times, several methods have been proposed for parameter estimation of these models. These methods however are either statistically sub-optimal or computationally burdensome, specially for two dimensional (2D) chirp models. In this paper, we consider the problem of parameter estimation of 2D chirp models and propose a computationally efficient estimator and establish asymptotic theoretical properties of the proposed estimators. And the proposed estimators are observed to have the same rates of convergence as the least squares estimators (LSEs). Furthermore, the proposed estimators of chirp rate parameters are shown to be asymptotically optimal.

Estimation of parameters of two-dimensional random amplitude chirp signal in additive noise,"Swagata Nandi, Rhythm Grover, Debasis Kundu",2022/9,Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing,33,3,Springer US,"In this paper, we consider a two-dimensional random amplitude chirp signal model. It is assumed that the additive error is independent and identically distributed. This is an extension of the one dimensional random amplitude chirp model proposed by Besson et al. (IEEE Trans Signal Process 47(12):3208–3219, 1999) to two-dimension. The random amplitudes can be thought of as a multiplicative error and are assumed to be independent and identically distributed with non-zero mean such that the fourth order moment exists. The parameters are estimated by maximizing a two-dimensional chirp periodogram like function and discuss their theoretical properties.

We derive, in this paper, the asymptotic properties of least squares estimators and sequential least squares estimators of the parameters of a chirp-like signal model.

Robust Estimators of Two-Dimensional Sinusoidal Model Parameters,"Debasis Kundu, Rhythm Grover",,Available at SSRN 4290828,,,,"In this manuscript, we consider a two-dimensional (2-D) sinusoidal model. This particular model has several applications in statistical signal processing and texture analysis. Extensive work has been done in developing several efficient procedures and establishing their properties. The least squares estimators (LSEs) are known to be the most efficient estimators in presence of additive noise. But it is observed that the accuracy of the LSEs is easily affected by even small perturbations in the data. In this manuscript, we propose to use the weighted least squares estimators (WLSEs) of the parameters that are unknown in presence of additive white noise. It is observed that the WLSEs are more robust towards outliers than the LSEs. Moreover, the WLSEs behave in the same manner as one of the most well-known robust estimators, the least absolute deviation estimators (LADEs). It is observed that developing the properties of the LADEs is not straightforward. Here, we derive the asymptotic properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed WLSEs.

A Review on Chirp and Some Other Related Signal Processing Models,"Debasis Kundu, Rhythm Grover, Swagata Nandi",,,,,,"Analyzing periodic or nearly periodic signals is a fundamental problem in Signal Processing. If the signal is periodic, then the sum of sinusoidal model has been used quite extensively to analyze the signal. But if the signal is nearly periodic, then sinusoidal model may not be very effective. Different alternative models have been proposed in the Signal Processing literature to analyze nearly periodic signal. The Chirp model is one such model which has been used quite effectively to analyze nearly periodic signal. The Chirp model has received a considerable amount of attention in the Signal Processing literature and an extensive amount of work has been published in this topic during the last three decades. The main aim of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive review of chirp and various related models which are available in the literature and which have been used to analyze periodic and nearly periodic data both in one and two dimensions.
