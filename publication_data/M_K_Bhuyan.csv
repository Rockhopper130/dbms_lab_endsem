Can Adversarial Networks Make Uninformative Colonoscopy Video Frames Clinically Informative?,"Vanshali Sharma, MK Bhuyan, Pradip K Das",2023/4/4,arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.02152,,,,"Various artifacts, such as ghost colors, interlacing, and motion blur, hinder diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC) from videos acquired during colonoscopy. The frames containing these artifacts are called uninformative frames and are present in large proportions in colonoscopy videos. To alleviate the impact of artifacts, we propose an adversarial network based framework to convert uninformative frames to clinically relevant frames. We examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach by evaluating the translated frames for polyp detection using YOLOv5. Preliminary results present improved detection performance along with elegant qualitative outcomes. We also examine the failure cases to determine the directions for future work.",0,"Can Adversarial Networks Make Uninformative Colonoscopy Video Frames Clinically Informative?

A Hand Gesture-operated System for Rehabilitation using an End-to-End Detection Framework,"H Pallab Jyoti Dutta, MK Bhuyan, Debanga Raj Neog, Karl F MacDorman, RH Laskar",2023/3/2,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,,,IEEE,"We propose a hand gesture-operated system as an AI application to relieve discomfort and restore function in hand and arm movements caused by injuries and nerve and muscle complications. The system trains patients with hand exercises, such as performing hand gestures accurately, traversing within specified bounds, and operating a hand gesture calculator. However, the system requires accurate hand gesture detection, which is impeded by background clutter and variations in illumination and in the hand's size and angle. To address this, we developed a robust hand detection module that uses a single-stage transformer deep network.

"Detection, tracking, and recognition of isolated multi-stroke gesticulated characters","Kuldeep Singh Yadav, Anish Monsley Kirupakaran, Rabul Hussain Laskar, MK Bhuyan",2023/2/23,Pattern Analysis and Applications,,,Springer London,"The detection and tracking of the bare hand are the most vital stages in the bare hand gesticulated character recognition system. Applying detection and tracking in an uncontrolled environment is quite challenging due to the variations in pose, position, illumination, occlusion, scale, rotation, speed, and bare hand-like impostors in the background or foreground. The motion blur due to speed variation makes it more complex. A computationally efficient object localization approach, i.e., region-based convolutional neural network on the selective region (RCNN-SR), is introduced in this work to detect the bare hand by overcoming these challenges at a certain level.

Efficient Context Integration through Factorized Pyramidal Learning for Ultra-Lightweight Semantic Segmentation,"Nadeem Atif, Saquib Mazhar, Debajit Sarma, MK Bhuyan, Shaik Rafi Ahamed",2023/2/23,arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.11785,,,,"Semantic segmentation is a pixel-level prediction task to classify each pixel of the input image. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been extremely successful in achieving excellent performances in this domain. However, mobile application, such as autonomous driving, demand real-time processing of incoming stream of images. Hence, achieving efficient architectures along with enhanced accuracy is of paramount importance. Since, accuracy and model size of CNNs are intrinsically contentious in nature, the challenge is to achieve a decent trade-off between accuracy and model size. To address this, we propose a novel Factorized Pyramidal Learning (FPL) module to aggregate rich contextual information in an efficient manner. On one hand, it uses a bank of convolutional filters with multiple dilation rates which leads to multi-scale context aggregation; crucial in achieving better accuracy. On the other hand, parameters are reduced by a careful factorization of the employed filters; crucial in achieving lightweight models. Moreover, we decompose the spatial pyramid into two stages which enables a simple and efficient feature fusion within the module to solve the notorious checkerboard effect. We also design a dedicated Feature-Image Reinforcement (FIR) unit to carry out the fusion operation of shallow and deep features with the downsampled versions of the input image. This gives an accuracy enhancement without increasing model parameters.

Lymph node detection in CT scans using modified U-Net with residual learning and 3D deep network,"Yashwanth Manjunatha, Vanshali Sharma, Yuji Iwahori, MK Bhuyan, Aili Wang, Akira Ouchi, Yasuhiro Shimizu",2023/1/11,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,,,Springer International Publishing,"Purpose
Lymph node (LN) detection is a crucial step that complements the diagnosis and treatments involved during cancer investigations. However, the low-contrast structures in the CT scan images and the nodes’ varied shapes, sizes, and poses, along with their sparsely distributed locations, make the detection step challenging and lead to many false positives. The manual examination of the CT scan slices could be time-consuming, and false positives could divert the clinician’s focus. To overcome these issues, our work aims at providing an automated framework for LNs detection in order to obtain more accurate detection results with low false positives.

Development of an intelligent recognition system for dynamic mid-air gesticulation of isolated alphanumeric keys,"Anish Monsley Kirupakaran, Kuldeep Singh Yadav, Rabul Hussain Laskar, Manas Kamal Bhuyan",2022/12/30,Expert Systems with Applications,210,,Pergamon,"Detecting and recognizing naturally gesticulated characters in mid-air is difficult because of the complexity arising due to (i) gesticulation style; (ii) gesture’s pattern and size. This worsens further when the gesticulation speed is faster causing the gesture object to be blurred in some of the frames. To ensure that the trajectory formed is equivalent to the intended gesticulation and be robust to the impostor’s presence, we propose red marker-detection and tracking (RM-DT) approach. This uses channel subtraction, thresholding, compact (hand) criteria, and Kalman filter to detect and track the gesture object to form the gesture trajectory (accuracy of ∼96 %; mAP – 0.9419). Unlike handwritten characters, the gesticulated trajectory incorporates the self co-articulated strokes that increases the rate of misclassification at the recognition stage.

Automated segmentation of such polyps from the highly acquired colonoscopy frames lessens the doctors’ burden and enhances efficiency. In our method, polyps, which are the colonoscopy frames’ salient regions, are detected using a deep convolutional architecture based on U-Net.

Removal of self co-articulation and recognition of dynamic hand gestures using deep architectures,"Kuldeep Singh Yadav, Songhita Misra, Rabul Hussain Laskar, Taimoor Khan, MK Bhuyan",2022/1/1,Applied Soft Computing,114,,Elsevier,"Natural gesticulation in-air is multifaceted, as defining a gesture’s pattern/size/speed or its stroke information is difficult. The unavailability of vision-based techniques to distinguish the ground truth stroke segments and the intentional movements (self co-articulation) results in capturing everything on the trajectory. But recognizing the gesture patterns (A–Z, a–z, 0–9, 04 operators, and 29 symbols) along with their self co-articulations results in the rise of misclassification. Hence, gestures are separated into 3 sets based on their physical structures using an artificial neural network. Then, set specific pre-processing models are proposed to remove these self co-articulations. As a result, a mean error rate of 0.0112 (ground truth segment removed) and 5.63% of self co-articulations present in the gesture patterns is obtained.

A comprehensive analysis of these features is presented in this paper. Shape features are extracted using generic Fourier descriptor. The nonsubsampled contourlet transform is used as texture and color feature descriptor, with different combinations of filters. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is applied to measure statistical significance of the contribution of different descriptors between two colonic polyps: non-neoplastic and neoplastic. Final descriptors selected after ANOVA are optimized using the fuzzy entropy-based feature ranking algorithm.

Photometric constraint equation derived from the Lambert reflectance and geometrical constraint equation derived from the relationship between the neighboring points are used and these equations can make a new approximation equation of Eikonal equation under the point light source illumination and perspective projection. The original endoscope image is transformed and generated to the Lambertian image by removing the specular reflectance.

Self co‐articulations are intentional movements performed by an individual to complete a gesture, whose presence in the trajectory alters its original meaning. For recognition, most researchers have directly used the trajectory formed along with these self co‐articulated strokes, with a few removing it using visible trait‐like velocity. Usage of velocity has shortcomings as gesturing in air differs from gesturing over a solid surface; hence, we propose a gesture formation model, which incorporates global and local measures to remove these self co‐articulations.

Technol.,7,5,,"In recent times, several studies focused on the global warming that may affect the hydrological cycle due to intensification of temporal and spatial variations in precipitation. Such climatic change is likely to impact significantly upon freshwater resources availability. In India, demand for water has already increased manifold over the years due to urbanization, agriculture expansion, increasing population, rapid industrialization and economic development. Numerous scientific studies also report increases in the intensity, duration, and spatial extents of floods, higher atmospheric temperatures, warmer sea, changes in precipitation patterns, and changing groundwater levels. This work briefly discusses about the present scenario regarding impact of climate change on water resources in India. Due to the insufficient resolution of climate models and their generally crude representation of sub-grid scale and convective processes, little confidence can be placed in any definite predictions of such effects, although a tendency for more heavy rainfall events seems likely, and a modest increase in frequency in floods. Thus to analyses this effect, this work considers real problems about the changing flood characteristics pattern in two river regions, and the effect of spatial and temporal pattern in rainfall. In addition to these, the work also examines the trend of groundwater level fluctuations in few blocks of Ganga–Yamuna and Sutlej-Yamuna Link interfluves region. As a whole, it examines the potential for sustainable development of surface water and groundwater resources within the constraints imposed by climate change.",1,"A Review of Case Studies on Climate Change Impact on Hydrologic Cycle: An Indian Perspective

But, it requires more than one cardiovascular signals involving more than one sensing device. In this paper, we propose a method for continuous cuffless blood pressure measurement with the help of left ventricular ejection time (LVET). The LVET is estimated using a signal obtained through a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor. The sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are estimated by calibrating the system with the original arterial blood pressure values of the subjects. The proposed method is evaluated using different quantitative measures on the signals collected from ten subjects under the supine position. The performance of the proposed method is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are estimated from electrocardiogram (ECG)-photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG-PPG, respectively. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods.

Here the objective is to track the movement of the hand irrespective of the shape, size, and color of the hand. And, for this, a motion template guided by optical flow (OFMT) is proposed. OFMT is a compact representation of the motion information of a gesture encoded into a single image. In the experimentation, different datasets using bare hand with an open palm, and folded palm wearing green-glove are used, and in both cases, we could generate the OFMT images with equal precision.

A novel algorithm for shot boundary detection and segmentation of broadcast news videos,"Pranabjyoti Haloi, MK Bhuyan, Pooja Rani Borah, Dibyajyoti Chatterjee",2020/7/2,,,,IEEE,"News videos are an important means of conveying information. But the number of news broadcasted each day in a particular channel is very large and considering the number of news channels, it is a huge amount of information conveyed each day. Sorting of news videos plays a very important role in such cases to create a well-categorized database of news videos. Broadcast news video shot segmentation is one of the vital parts of sorting. This paper presents a novel algorithm that can detect the shot boundaries of news videos efficiently and perform shot segmentation accordingly.

Image specific discriminative feature extraction for skin segmentation,"Biplab Ketan Chakraborty, Manas Kamal Bhuyan",2020/7,Multimedia Tools and Applications,79,27-28,Springer US,"In recent times, the majority of colour-based skin detection methods used skin modelling in different colour spaces, and they are capable of skin classification at a pixel level. However, the accuracy of these methods is significantly affected by different issues, such as the presence of skin-like colours in scene background, variations in skin pigmentation, scene illumination, etc. Recent developments show that the discriminating power of a colour-based skin classifier can be increased by employing texture and spatial features. However, we observed that discriminability between skin and non-skin regions does not follow any statistics, and the discrimination is extremely image specific. In this paper, a novel adaptive discriminative analysis (ADA) is proposed to extract most discriminant features between skin and non-skin regions from an image itself in an unsupervised manner.

The aim of the proposed framework is to assess the human respiratory system by identifying degree-of-breathings, such as breathlessness, normal breathing, and long and labored breathing. For this, it is needed to measure cardiac-induced chest-wall vibrations, reflected in the SCG signal. Orthogonal subspace projection is employed to extract the SCG cycles with the help of a concurrent ECG signal. Subsequently, fifteen statistically significant morphological-features are extracted from each of the SCG cycles. These features can efficiently characterize physiological changes due to varying respiratory rates. Stacked autoencoder (SAE) based architecture is employed for the identification of different respiratory-effort levels. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with other standard classifiers for 1147 analyzed SCG-beats. The proposed method gives an overall average accuracy of 91.45% in recognizing three different breathing states. The quantitative analysis of the performance results clearly shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework. It may be employed in various healthcare applications, such as pre-screening medical sensors and IoT based remote health-monitoring systems.",7,"Design of breathing-states detector for m-health platform using seismocardiographic signal

Change in heart cycle morphologies is a vital diagnostic feature for cardiac clinical systems. A seismocardiogram (SCG) signal provides more detailed information of different cardiac phases in a heart cycle compared to other cardiac signals. Hence, heart cycle extraction using SCG is very important to examine cardiac activities. In this manuscript, an orthogonal subspace projection based framework is proposed to extract heart cycles from a SCG signal. The heart cycle is estimated by calculating intervals between consecutive aortic valve opening (AO) instants, and post aortic valve closing (postAC) instants. Orthogonal subspace projection is applied to the SCG signal on ECG subspace for AO peak detection. The signal generated from projection gives the locations of AO peaks in the SCG signal.

Polyp shapes play an important role in colorectal diagnosis. However, endoscopy images are usually composed of nonrigid objects such as a polyp. Hence, it is challenging for polyp shape recovery. It is demanded to establish a support system of the colorectal diagnosis system based on polyp shape.
Introduction:
Shape from Shading (SFS) is one valuable approach based on photoclinometry for polyp shape recovery. SFS and endoscope image are compatible on the first sight, but there are constraints for applying SFS to endoscope image. Those approaches need some parameters like a depth from the endoscope lens to the surface, and surface reflectance factor. Furthermore, those approaches assume the whole surface which has the same value of for the Lambertian surface.
Methods:
This paper contributes to mitigating constraint for applying SFS to the endoscope image based on a cue from the medical structure. An extracted medical suture is used to estimate parameters, and a method of polyp shape recovery method is proposed using both geometric and photometric constraint equations. Notably, the proposed method realizes polyp shape recovery from a single endoscope image.
Results:
From experiments it was confirmed that the approximate polyp model shape was recovered and the proposed method recovered absolute size and shape of polyp using medical suture information and obtained parameters from a single endoscope image.
Conclusion:
This paper proposed a polyp shape recovery method which mitigated the constraint for applying SFS to the endoscope image using the medical suture. Notably, the proposed …",1,"Polyp Shape Recovery from Single Endoscope Image using Medical Suture

These methods are used to fuse computed tomography (CT) images with magnetic resonance images (MRI), MR-T1 images with MR-T2 images, and MR images with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images. In proposed method, nonsubsampled shearlet transform (NSST) is used for decomposition of source images to attain the low-frequency and high-frequency bands. The low-frequency bands are fused using weighted saliency-based fusion criteria, and high-frequency bands are fused with the help of phase stretch transform (PST) features. Applying inverse NSST operation, fused image is obtained. The results show the proposed method produces better results compared to state-of-the-art methods.",1,"An efficient algorithm for medical image fusion using nonsubsampled shearlet transform

After classification, a vessel extraction method is proposed which is based on the Frangi vesselness approach. In original Frangi Vesselness results, it is observed that many non-blood vessel edges are inaccurately detected as blood vessels. So, two additions are proposed, background subtraction and a novel dissimilarity-detecting filtering procedure, which are able to discriminate between blood vessel and non-blood vessel edges by exploiting the symmetric nature property of blood vessels. It was found that the proposed approach gave better accuracy of blood vessel extraction when compared with the vanilla Frangi Vesselness approach and BCOSFIRE filter, another state-of-art vessel delineation approach.",3,"A Robust Method for Blood Vessel Extraction in Endoscopic Images with SVM-based Scene Classification.

Tracking with moving camera sometimes fails to track the object with similar color objects or similar background. Proposed approach is a particle filter based approach. It introduces the likelihood calculated by probabilistic background model which is constructed using dense optical flow and fast density estimation. Proposed approach introduces SVM (Support Vector Machine)1 to judge the scene where it is difficult to construct the probabilistic background model with non-uniform optical flow. This SVM uses the degree histogram of optical flow.

In this paper, a novel skin detection method utilizing image pixel distribution in a given colour space is proposed. The pixel distribution of an image can provide a better localization of the actual skin colour distribution of an image. Hence, a local skin distribution model (LSDM) is derived using the image pixel distribution model and its similarity with the global skin distribution model (GSDM). Finally, a fusion-based skin model is obtained using both the GSDM and the LSDM. Subsequently, a dynamic region growing method is employed to improve the overall detection rate.

The proposed method targets image sequences taken by a moving camera and is based on the particle filter. Tracking methods using color information tend to track mistakenly a background region or an object with color similar to the target object. The method constructs the probabilistic background model by the histogram of the optical flow and defines the likelihood function so that the likelihood in the region of the target object may become large. This causes increasing the accuracy of tracking. The probabilistic background model is made by the density forests. It can infer a probabilistic density fast. Results are demonstrated by experiments using the real videos of outdoor scenes.,6,"Tracking with probabilistic background model by density forests

Nevertheless, diversion problem of different magnitude exist at all such projects and the schemes are always site-specific. The problem of execution, cost incurred and the time taken for works vary with size of the project and flood potential of the stream. Hence, the diversion schemes of such projects are generally planned prior to the commencement of the construction activities. A case study of Kanupur Dam Project in Odisha state is studied, where construction activity of the earthen dam started on both flanks of the dam much earlier to finalization of diversion scheme. Hydrologic study of a typical river diversion scheme proposed for construction of the earth dam in the river gap portion is presented in this paper.

Gabor wavelet is one of the most widely used filters for image feature extraction. Existing Gabor wavelet-based feature extraction methodologies unnecessarily use both the real and the imaginary coefficients, which are subsequently processed by dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, LDA etc. This procedure ultimately affects the overall performance of the algorithm in terms of memory requirement and the computational complexity.

An initial skin mask is obtained by a dynamic thresholding of the skin probability map. The Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means (PFCM) clustering is employed to group the initially detected pixels into two clusters: a true-skin cluster and a false-skin cluster. Experimental results show that the proposed method can perform well when there is a color similarity between the skin-colored foreground regions and the scene background.",9,"Skin segmentation using possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering in presence of skin-colored background

Contextual emotion learning challenge,"Praveen Kumar Velpula, MK Bhuyan, JP Colombier, R Stoian",2015/8/1,,,,,"[en] Full text: Ultrafast laser volume interaction with transparent materials can achieve localized structural transformations and embedded changes of the dielectric function. Matter compaction or rarefaction can be determined by material properties, its thermal history or the level of the energy deposition, having strong influence on the fabrication quality and accuracy in 3D laser-material processing. Employing non-diffractive nonlinear ultrafast Bessel optical beams with quasi-stationary characteristics allows remarkable potential for energy localization beyond the diffraction limit. The ability to maintain near-constant intensity profiles over an appreciable distance along the propagation direction, sustaining nonlinear absorption, recommends non-diffractive concepts for high aspect ratio submicron structuring applications. Furthermore, in the presence of nonlinear propagation, the material response can be critically determined by the pulse temporal envelope, impacting on photo-inscription regimes, ie formation of various types of refractive index structures. If smooth positive index structures can be produced for ultrashort exposure, one-dimensional void structures are obtained for tailored dispersion-engineered pulses, highlighting the important contribution of delayed ionization and light diffusion on excited carriers. Nonlinear simulations confirm the different energy balance driven by the pulse envelope. Thus photoionization mechanisms can be synchronized and self-limiting effects in carrier plasmas can be overcome leading to an unprecedented localization of laser energy on scales well below the incident wavelength, and the laser pulse duration …",0,"Spatio-temporal dynamics of non-diffractive ultrafast laser excitation and nanostructuring in bulk silica glass

Then, QP for each frame is estimated on the basis of the motion content in each frame. More motion leads to more burden of bits while encoding the motion vectors. Also, quantization noise is less prominent in high‐motioned frames than frames possessing low motion information because of the temporal masking phenomenon of the human eyes.

These methods cannot reliably recognize non-cooperating individuals at a distance in the real world under changing environmental conditions. Gait, which concerns recognizing individuals by the way they walk, is a relatively new biometric without these disadvantages. The inherent gait characteristic of an individual makes it irreplaceable and useful in visual surveillance.
In this paper, an efficient gait recognition system for human identification by extracting two features namely width vector of the binary silhouette and the MPEG-7-based region-based shape descriptors is proposed. In the proposed method, foreground objects ie, human and other moving objects are extracted by estimating background information by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and subsequently, median filtering operation is performed for removing noises in the background subtracted image. A moving target classification algorithm is used to separate human being (ie, pedestrian) from other foreground objects (viz., vehicles). Shape and boundary information is used in the moving target classification algorithm. Subsequently, width vector of the outer contour of binary silhouette and the MPEG-7 Angular Radial Transform coefficients are taken as the feature vector. Next, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the selected feature vector to reduce its dimensionality.

The numerous approaches to this problem differ in the type of background model used. This paper discusses the modeling of each pixel as a mixture of Gaussian distribution. Subsequently, an on-line approximation is used to update the model. We proposed to employ median filtering along with connected component labeling. These two steps ensures a fine object model for the tracking framework.

By using this, identification of moving objects from background scene has to be done. Perfect background subtraction is essential to get a high recognition rate.

In this paper, we consider a form of dynamic hand gestures that are characterized by total movement of the hand (arm) in space. For these types of gestures, the shape of the hand (palm) during gesturing does not bear any significance. In our work, we propose a model-based method for tracking hand motion in space, thereby estimating the hand motion trajectory. We employ the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm for time alignment and normalization of spatio-temporal variations that exist among samples belonging to the same gesture class. During training, one template trajectory and one prototype feature vector are generated for every gesture class. Features used in our work include some static and dynamic motion trajectory features. Recognition is accomplished in two stages. In the first stage, all unlikely gesture classes are eliminated by comparing the input gesture trajectory to all the template trajectories. In the next stage, feature vector extracted from the input gesture is compared to all the class prototype feature vectors using a distance classifier.

A framework for continuous fingerspelling spotting for H. 264/AVC compressed videos using spatio-temporal Markov random field,"MK Bhuyan, Debashish Ghosh, PK Bora",2005/11/21,,,,IEEE,"The task of automatic gesture recognition is highly challenging due to the presence of unpredictable and ambiguous non gesture hand motions referred to as co-articulation. Due to co-articulation that occurs during transition from one gesture to the next, problem is encountered in continuous hand gesture recognition. In this paper, we have shown that co-articulation may be tackled by identifying the key frames in the gesture video sequence. We propose an acceleration feature for isolating the non gestural motions between meaningful gestural indications during trajectory guided recognition of hand gesture. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness our proposed scheme in identifying co-articulation in gestures thereby improving the gesture recognition rate.",10,"Co-articulation detection in hand gestures

This paper describes a system which enables a robot to recognize and respond to hand gestures from a human operator. The interface uses some predefined hand gestures, each of which represents an individual control command for the motion control of the remote robot.

In the next step, the centroids of all VOPs are calculated using moments as well as motion information. Finally, the hand trajectory is estimated by joining the VOP centroids.

Plasmodium falciparum was the dominant parasite which accounted 64.2 per cent of the total infections. Results of mass blood survey indicated the presence of high percentage of asymptomatic carriers of malaria parasites in the local populace. In an entomological survey, 25 species of mosquitoes under five genera were collected in 20 trap nights. The average density of mosquitoes recorded was 230.6 per trap night. Anopheles mosquitoes alone accounted 72.8 per cent of the total collection whereas malaria vectors Anopheles maculatus, An. minimus, An. philippinensis, An. varuna and An. annularis accounted 32.8 per cent of the total anophelines collected. Both anopheline and culicine mosquitoes were found susceptible to DDT (4 per cent) and malathion (5 per cent) in 30 min exposure. Dissection of malaria vectors An. minimus, An. maculatus and An. philippinensis revealed very high percentage of parity rate (77.8 per cent) which gives a strong indication about their vectorial status in the transmission of malaria.

In this paper, a 3-D shape reconstruction of computer vision technology is introduced in the medical diagnosis for this purpose. Some approaches based on Shape from Shading have been proposed for polyp in endoscope image. Previous approaches need some parameters such as depth parameter Z from endoscope lens to the surface point and reflectance parameter C. In the endoscope image, it is important to obtain these parameters for accurate polyp shape recovery. This paper proposes a new approach for obtaining parameters Z and C from one endoscope image where a medical suture is taken. A medical suture is used to estimate the horizontal plane locally and an observation model of medical suture is used with the horizontal plane. Two light sources endoscope observation system is assumed based on the actual endoscope for improving the accuracy of the polyp shape recovery.

The main objective of this work is to develop a comprehensive model for reallife application for cervical dysplasia, with highest degree of accuracy and lowest computation time. The study first builds the model required for training and testing the system to classify the dysplasia. Three different color models, three transforms each with different filters, two feature representation schemes and two well-known classification techniques are applied in combination with each other to identify the best combination of “transform (filter)⇒ color model⇒ feature representation⇒ classifier”. Extended experiments on two databases, one indigenous, the other public, proved that the NSCT based classification perform highly satisfactory for both the databases and that the complete model proposed gives the most satisfactory result till date.",0,"Automated cervical dysplasia detection: a multi-resolution transform based approach

The final purpose is to distinguish a problematic defect, such as disconnection from a non-defect, dust in the manufacturing process et al. Keypoints are extracted from the electronic circuit board image, then a patch image is cropped using obtained keypoint information, such as the position. The cropped images are used as input to CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and 4096-dimensional features are obtained in the final layer of the full connected layers. SVM (Support Vector Machine) is introduced for learning and classification using CNN features. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through a detection experiment using actual electronic circuit board images containing defects and by comparing the results with the previous method.",0,"Defect Detection and Classification of Electronic Circuit Boards Using Keypoint Extraction and CNN Features

Study on production and extraction of negative impurity ions in a caesiated negative ion source,"PK Bhunya, AJ Adeloye, MK Bhuyan, Joygopal Jena, SOA ITER",,,,,,"A rainfall-runoff simulation model, based on a modified non-linear reservoir, is presented. The existing dynamic equation where storage in a catchment is defined as a function of only runoff is modified by introduction of a time lag parameter, which simplifies the equation to an explicit form. The method uses adjusted runoff (product of a coefficient and runoff) as a variable with accumulated storage with a time lag to establish a rainfall-runoff relationship. The performance of the model is tested on short-term rainfall and runoff data of two Indian catchments, and published data of Wills Creek and Shoal Creek. The coefficient of determination R 2 for the plot of runoff (QD) versus Storage S (t-τ) ranges from 0.83 to 0.975. The coefficient of the present non linear model defines against the storm magnitude and the R 2 value reaches up to 0.72. Further, the estimated flood hydrographs using the present approach are compared with the Nash (1959) model, and with the results given by optimization model of Mays and Taur (1982) and Prasad et al.(1999). The STDER values associated with the present nonlinear model are 4.4 and 79.8 for two study areas respectively, which are less compared to other approaches of Nash (1959), Mays & Taur (1982), Prasad et al.(1999)",0,"A Simple Non-Linear Rainfall-Runoff Model for Small Catchments

Colorectal polyp classification based on latent sharing features domain from multiple endoscopy images,"P Prem Kiran, S Bagchi, MK Bhuyan, M Krishnamurthy, G Ravindra Kumar",,,,,,"When an intense, femtosecond laser pulse interacts with matter, instantaneous ionization occurs producing free electrons which further absorbs energy by different collisional and collisionless absorption processes leading to form hot dense plasma, a rich source of x-rays,‘hot’electrons and fast energetic ions [1]. Some electrons because of their higher kinetic energy can break through the plasma creating a potential sheath layer by inducing a positive charge to quasineutral plasma [2]. This potential difference in the sheath layer pulls out ions from the plasma and accelerates them to higher energies in a very short time and lengthscale [3]. Evidently the most crucial role in this entire process is played by the ‘hot’electrons, which depends mainly on the efficient coupling of laser energy in to the plasma. In this paper, we address the issue of enhanced laser coupling to plasma as a route to achieve an efficient fast particle …",0,"Impact of periodic surface modulations on ion emission from intense, femtosecond laser produced plasmas

In India the abundance of Simuliurn spp.(locally known as dimdam flies) and their biting nuisance is well known in the northeastern region (Perti 1963). During the early sixties, susceptibility of Simulium. Iarvae to insecticides with small scale field trials using DDT and BHC were carried out in NEFA (North-East Frontier Agency-now Arunachal Pradesh) by Perti and Lopez (1964). Das et al.(1981) reported the susceptibility of Sim. ulium himalayense Puri larvae to certain insecticides in this area. Though Simulium or blackfly bites can be avoided by using selective insect repellents (Das et al. 1985), an effective control program must be based on larviciding the river systems. Temephos (Abate@) appears to be the larvicide of choice due to its biodegradable nature and low mammalian toxicity. In the present study the acute toxicity and carry of Abatel 500E and Teknar2 (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis, serotype H-14) were studied and compared with the available data ofthe conventional insecticide DDT to obtain a better understanding of their true utilization.",0,"FIELD TRIAL OF ABATE@ AND TEKNAR@ FOP'SIMULIUM (DIPTERA: SIMULIIDAE) CONTROL IN INDIA

Recognition of these gestures require both the hand trajectory and hand shape information. The proposed system is designed so that it can distinguish and recognize different classes of hand gestures having different spatio-temporal behaviour. The system uses finite state machine, where hand shape information along with temporal characteristics of the gesticulating hand plays important role in recognition. Moreover the spatial hand position and hand motion features are considered for recognition.
