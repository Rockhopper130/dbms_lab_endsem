Dynamic Data Assimilation for Improved Streamflow Forecast Using Sensitive Soil Moisture Observations,"Ramesh Visweshwaran, Raaj Ramsankaran, TI Eldho, S Lakshmivarahan",2022/11/22,Authorea Preprints,,,Authorea,"The accuracy of streamflow forecasts is important for efficient monitoring and mitigation of flood events. Unfortunately, the uncertainty in the model control variable which includes model parameters, initial and boundary conditions, propagates through the model, resulting in the degradation of streamflow forecast. Various studies in the past have shown the potential of soil moisture assimilation in hydrological models resulting in the improved forecast. Further, the efficiency of assimilation is based on the number and the distribution of observations used. This study proposes a new approach called Forward sensitivity method (FSM), which operates in two phases. By running the model and forecast sensitivity dynamics forward in time, the first phase places the observations at or near where the square of the forecast sensitivity with respect to the control takes maximum values. Then using only this subset of observations, the second phase estimates the unknown elements of the control by solving a resulting weighted least squares problem. The power of this approach is demonstrated by assimilating ASCAT soil moisture observations into a conceptual Two Parameter Model in a medium sized watershed lying in the Krishna River Basin, India. The model run extends for four monsoon years from June 2007 to June 2011 and two assimilation scenarios were tested. The first scenario uses all the observations, whereas, the second uses only sensitive observations during assimilation and the results were then compared against open loop simulation (model run without assimilation). Sensitivity results indicate that observations during monsoon time alone are …",0,"Dynamic Data Assimilation for Improved Streamflow Forecast Using Sensitive Soil Moisture Observations

Role of the Observability Gramian in Parameter Estimation: Application to Nonchaotic and Chaotic Systems via the Forward Sensitivity Method,"John M Lewis, Sivaramakrishnan Lakshmivarahan",2022/10/10,Atmosphere,13,10,MDPI,"Data assimilation in chaotic regimes is challenging, and among the challenging aspects is placement of observations to induce convexity of the cost function in the space of control. This problem is examined by using Saltzman’s spectral model of convection that admits both chaotic and nonchaotic regimes and is controlled by two parameters—Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. The problem is simplified by stripping the seven-variable constraint to a three-variable constraint. Since emphasis is placed on observation positioning to avoid cost-function flatness, forecast sensitivity to controls is needed. Four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) is silent on this issue of observation placement while Forecast Sensitivity Method (FSM) delivers sensitivities used in placement. With knowledge of the temporal forecast sensitivity matrix V, derivatives of the forecast variables to controls, the cost function can be expressed as a function of the observability Gramian VTV using first-order Taylor series expansion. The goal is to locate observations at places that force the Gramian positive definite. Further, locations are chosen such that the condition number of VTV is small and this guarantees convexity in the vicinity of the cost function minimum. Four numerical experiments are executed, and results are compared with the structure of the cost function independently determined though arduous computation over a wide range of the two nondimensional numbers. The results are especially good based on reduction in cost function value and comparison with cost function structure.",0,"Role of the Observability Gramian in Parameter Estimation: Application to Nonchaotic and Chaotic Systems via the Forward Sensitivity Method

Placement of observations to correct return-flow forecasts,"John M Lewis, S Lakshmivarahan, Junjun Hu, Robert Rabin",2020,,15,,,"The continued presence of systematic errors in operational forecasts of return flow over the Gulf of Mexico has motivated an investigation into this problem. The theme of the work is use of a low-order mixed-layer model that is faithful to the phenomenon in the context of dynamic data assimilation. Data assimilation experiments in the identical-twin mode determine the best place to make observations that minimize the forecast error through adjustment of model controls. The emphasized controls are those associated with the fluxes of heat and moisture from sea to atmosphere. Results indicate that the best observations are at that time and place when the outflowing continental air passes over the warmest sea surface temperatures. In the case studied, this warmest zone is directly over the Loop Current. Observations at times long after the modified air leaves these warmest waters lead to relatively poor control adjustments and little improvement in the forecast. If input to data assimilation is restricted to observations of a single model variable over short intervals of time (the order of several hours), results are relatively poor. Yet, a significant improvement is forthcoming if one of the observations is replaced by an observation from another model variable. This result is understood through arguments based on forecast sensitivity to model control. The paper ends with discussion of steps to be taken that hold promise for correcting systematic error in return-flow forecasts.",2,"Placement of observations to correct return-flow forecasts

One of the most important means of achieving this is to use spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets of critical aerosol properties, such as spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA), which are the most important parameters for estimating aerosol radiative effects. However, observations do not provide the above; the space-borne observations though provide wide spatial coverage, are temporal snapshots and suffer from possible sensor degradation over extended periods. On the other hand, the ground-based measurements provide more accurate and temporally continuous data but are spatially near-point observations. Realizing the need for spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets on one hand and the near non-existence of such data over the south Asian region (which is one of the regions where aerosols show large heterogeneity in most of their properties), construction of accurate gridded aerosol products by synthesizing the long-term space-borne and ground-based data has been taken up as an important objective of the South West Asian Aerosol Monsoon Interactions (SWAAMI), a joint Indo-UK field campaign, aiming at characterizing aerosol–monsoon links and their variabilities over the Indian region.

A Structural Model for Optimal Selection of Maturity and Timing of Callable Bond Issuance,"Shengguang Qian, S Lakshmivarahan, Duane Stock",2016/12/31,The Journal of Fixed Income,26,3,Institutional Investor Journals Umbrella,"A major shortcoming of previous structural models for bonds is that they ignore how the complex terms of a call feature interact with default to determine term structures at issuance. A term structure of par coupon yields is different from and superior to a term structure based on the option-adjusted spread and, furthermore, is the most useful term structure for firms issuing bonds because it is the most accurate measure of the cost of debt. The authors present a par coupon structural model that can be used as an aid in timing bond issues because some parameters of the model have been proven to exhibit predictability. One can use the model to incorporate the impact of alternative future Federal Reserve policies for short-term interest rates upon the optimal timing and maturity of corporate bond issuance.

Ensemble forecasting of return flow over the Gulf of Mexico,"John M Lewis, S Lakshmivarahan, Junjun Hu, Roger Edwards, Robert A Maddox, Richard L Thompson, Stephen F Corfidi",2016/8/8,Electronic Journal of Severe Storms Meteorology,11,4,,"Errors in operational forecasts of return flow events (RFEs) over the Gulf of Mexico have dictated the search for sources of these errors. Based on earlier studies, likely candidates for these errors are: incorrect parameterization of turbulent transfer processes at the air-sea interface, uncertain vertical motion above the mixed layer, and incorrect initial conditions. We investigate these possible sources of error by performing numerical experiments with a Monte Carlo ensemble prediction model applied to a well-observed case in February 1988. In essence, we examine uncertainty in prediction due to uncertainty in the model’s elements of control. A mixed-layer model with roughly 50 elements of control is used to determine forecast uncertainty due to initial conditions alone, boundary conditions alone, parameterization alone, as well as the full complement of uncertainty in these elements of control. The uncertainty is calculated at points along a predetermined outflow trajectory that originates over shelf waters in the northeastern Gulf, passes north of the Yucatan Peninsula, and terminates in the west-central Gulf—all points along the trajectory are characterized by convective heating at the sea-air interface. Results from the numerical experiments led to the following results: 1) parameterization of physical processes exerts the greatest influence on forecast uncertainty, and 2) the water-vapor mass in the mixed-layer column is uncertain by a factor of two at the trajectory’s terminal point. The latter result confirms forecasters’ long-held view that vapor return is the most suspect product in operational prediction of RFEs.

Whereas optimal tracking through feedback control had its early history in application to vehicle trajectories in space science, the methodology has been adapted to geophysical dynamics by forcing the trajectory of a deterministic model to follow observations in accord with observation accuracy. Fundamentally, this offline (where it is assumed that the observations in a given assimilation window are all given) approach is based on Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP) where a least squares fit of idealized path to dynamic law follows from Hamiltonian mechanics. This utilitarian process optimally determines a forcing function that depends on the state (the feedback component) and the observations.

Learning algorithms theory and applications: theory and applications,Sivaramakrishnan Lakshmivarahan,2012/12/6,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Learning constitutes one of the most important phase of the whole psychological processes and it is essential in many ways for the occurrence of necessary changes in the behavior of adjusting organisms. In a broad sense influence of prior behavior and its consequence upon subsequent behavior is usually accepted as a definition of learning. Till recently learning was regarded as the prerogative of living beings. But in the past few decades there have been attempts to construct learning machines or systems with considerable success. This book deals with a powerful class of learning algorithms that have been developed over the past two decades in the context of learning systems modelled by finite state probabilistic automaton. These algorithms are very simple iterative schemes. Mathematically these algorithms define two distinct classes of Markov processes with unit simplex (of suitable dimension) as its state space. The basic problem of learning is viewed as one of finding conditions on the algorithm such that the associated Markov process has prespecified asymptotic behavior. As a prerequisite a first course in analysis and stochastic processes would be an adequate preparation to pursue the development in various chapters.,362,"Learning algorithms theory and applications: theory and applications

This situation can be overcome by introducing prior information (such as a forecast) into the functional, ie, inclusion of a term in the functional that fits the desired state to the forecast in accord with forecast accuracy.

Of course, numerous empirical studies find that call features can have a major impact on credit spreads and the required yield at issuance. We develop a structural model which includes a call feature and then answer many unanswered questions by computing the dollar value of call options at issuance and analyzing the complex simultaneous impact of term structure shape upon both credit risk and option value. As one finding among many, we find that call option value (at issuance) declines as credit quality declines. This is in contrast to previous studies that suggest the opposite relation.

Systematic Error Detection in Dynamical Models: A Framework,S Lakshmivarahan,2009/1/12,Eighth Conference on Coastal Atmospheric and Oceanic Prediction and Processes,,,,"It is the rule rather than the exception that operational weather prediction models exhibit systematic error. Over the Gulf of Mexico, the NCEP/EMC operational model has been plagued with systematic error in the marine-layer moisture for several decades—a negative bias from the late-1980s to the mid-1990s followed by a positive bias from the mid-1990s to the present. Despite a sustained effort by the research and operational community at NCEP/NHC, the biased forecast remains. The symptoms of the bias forecast can be ameliorated to a certain extent, ie, from knowledge of the bias, the data assimilation scheme can empirically alter the analysis. Clearly, it is preferable to identify and remove the source of the error. We have built a framework that searches for the source (s) of systematic error. We apply our methodology to the cool season weather regime that is linked to the systematic errors mentioned above—return flow over the Gulf where the consensus of opinion indicates that erroneous turbulent moisture/heat flux is the principal culprit. Rather than using the general operational model, a primitive equation model with a variety of parameterizations, we will use the mixed layer model that has been found to be appropriate for the generation of the convective boundary layer that forms during the outbound phase of return flow. The data we use were collected during the Gulf of Mexico Experiment (GUFMEX) in 1988.

Finding Sources of Bias Error in Forecast Models: A Framework,"S Lakshmivarahan, JM Lewis",2008/10,,,,,"A mathematical method has been developed to identify the sources of bias error in dynamical systems that can be represented by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. The basic tenet is that the forecast bias can be represented by a first-order Taylor series in the elements of the control vector—expressed in the form of sensitivity of model output to the initial condition and sensitivity of output to the parameters. Problem solution rests on a least squares formulation that accommodates over-determined/under-determined systems, ie, systems where the number of observations is greater than/less than the number of unknown elements of the control vector. A general framework is constructed and applied to the Lagrangian mixedlayer model that is applicable to the cold-air outflow phase of return flow over the Gulf of Mexico. Observations for a particular return-flow case are used to establish the idealized control vector and forecast. Bias is then added to this control vector and numerical experiments are executed to test the viability of the methodology. Principal results of the experiments are:(1) in all experiments, the bias correction is of the correct sign and the magnitude is close to the ideal,(2) the accuracy of the bias estimates improve with iteration, and (3) in the rank deficient systems, regularization leads to meaningful solutions.",0,"Finding Sources of Bias Error in Forecast Models: A Framework

First, we derive a set of sufficient conditions on the structural parameters (A(i), Bi and ci for i=1,2,…,n) for conserving energy.

Fundamentally, he formulated data assimilation as a constrained minimization problem with equality constraints. The generation of this idea is tracked by analyzing his education and research at the University of Tokyo in the immediate post–World War II (WWII) period. Despite austere circumstances—including limited financial support for education, poor living conditions, and a lack of educational resources—Sasaki was highly motivated and overcame these obstacles on his path to developing this innovative method of weather map analysis. The stages of his intellectual development are followed where information comes from access to his early publications, oral histories, and letters of reminiscence.",20,"Sasaki’s pivotal contribution: Calculus of variations applied to weather map analysis

Previous analysis has shown price volatility to depend upon duration and the volatility of interest rates. A more complete and accurate second-order model shows that price volatility also depends on predicted changes in yield and convexity. Municipal bond price volatility estimated by the more accurate second-order model can be much larger (200 per cent) than estimated first-order volatility. Analysts using only a first-order model can make large errors. Additionally, the effect of yield level on price volatility can be very different in first and second-order models.",0,"Lower-grade municipal bond price risk and sensitivity of price volatility to level of yields

The Distribution of the Value of the Firm and Stochastic Interest Rates: An Application to Structural Models of Default Risk,"S Lakshmivarahan, Shengguang Qian, Duane Stock",2007/12/2,,,,,"The time evolution of the value of a firm is commonly modeled by the linear, scalar stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the type t tt v t v dV rVdt t VdW where the coefficient tr in the drift term denotes the (exogenous) stochastic short term interest rate and v t
 is the given volatility of the value process. In turn, the dynamics of the short term interest rate, t dr, are modeled by a scalar SDE. We solve this pair of equations for a variety of commonly used interest rate processes which in turn provide explicit expressions for t V. We show that t V exhibits a lognormal distribution when tr is a normal/Gaussian process defined by a common variety of narrow sense linear SDEs. While we also provide explicit solutions for t V when tr evolves according to general linear and some well known nonlinear SDEs, the distribution of t V is not explicitly known in many of these other cases. The results can be applied to many financial situations where modeling value of the firm is critical. For example, there is a large literature concerning structural models of yields on corporate debt. Some structural models assume a constant rate of interest while others utilize, for example, interest rate models consistent with the popular Vasicek (1977) model. Our solutions for the distribution of t V readily permit detailed analysis of the term structure of default risky yields and credit spreads. More specifically, we analyze how the probability of default varies with maturity and, in turn, analyze the complex interactions of maturity, drift in t V, and variance of t V upon default risky yields and credit spreads.",0,"The Distribution of the Value of the Firm and Stochastic Interest Rates: An Application to Structural Models of Default Risk

Less risk for strong returns in bond portfolios,"S Lakshmivarahan, Duane R Stock",2007/9/30,The Journal of Fixed Income,17,2,Institutional Investor Journals Umbrella,"Bond portfolio managers obviously need good measures of the risk of their portfolios. The level of yields affects the variance of bond returns in a complex way because duration decreases (increases) as yields rise (fall). On the other hand, the volatility of yields frequently increases (decreases) as yields rise (fall). An additional complicating factor, especially important for longer maturities, is the negative relation of convexity to the level of yields. We show variance may increase or decrease with level of yield depending on the model used, bond maturity, and time varying conditional variance of yields. It is noteworthy that second order relationships can give rise to results that are dramatically different from first order. It is very useful and appealing that shorter maturity bond risk may decline with lower levels of yield and strong returns.

The Complex Effect of Yields on Bond Price Volatility,"S Lakshmivarahan, Duane R Stock",2007/1/2,,,,,"The purpose of this research is to analyze the relationship of variance in bond price changes, VP, to the level of interest rates (yields). We start by analyzing first and second order expressions for VP. First order expressions are appealing because they tend to be briefer and thus tend to be easier to implement. However, first order results are often grossly inaccurate and misleading. An obviously important question is whether VP is positively or negatively related to the level of interest rates (yields). To answer this, we utilize the derivative of VP with respect to yield for both first and second order models. We demonstrate that the answer (positive or negatively related) can be quite complex because the results are model specific, time specific, maturity specific, etc.",0,"The Complex Effect of Yields on Bond Price Volatility

Mining nexrad radar data: An investigative study,"Xiang Li, Rahul Ramachandran, John Rushing, Sara Graves, Kevin Kelleher, S Lakshmivarahan, Douglas Kennedy, Jason Levit",2004/1/14,American Meteorology Society annual meeting,,,,"A collaborative team of meteorologists and data mining experts conducted a case study to detect and classify mesocyclone signatures in WSR-88D radar data using mining techniques. Radar data for May 6th, 1994 and May 11th, 1992 from Norman and Tulsa, Oklahoma was used in this case study. Two Mesocyclone Detection Algorithms (MDA) were used in this study. One (NSSL MDA) is a computationally optimized version of the National Severe Storm Laboratory (NSSL) MDA. The second (UAH MDA) was created based upon the original NSSL algorithm, but with some image processing techniques. The primary difference between the two algorithms is in the technique used to segment the two dimensional (2D) mesocyclone signatures. The UAH MDA uses a region growing technique; hence the shape of the feature is no longer a restriction. True or false labels were assigned to the mesocyclone features generated from the MDA by comparing with a truth set derived by an expert using the NSSL algorithm. This labeled feature data set was then used in a series of analysis experiments. The objective of these experiments was to: Evaluate the performance of different classifiers in their ability to distinguish between a true mesocyclone signature versus an artifact or noise; Optimize the classification results by selecting key parameters from the feature data set using different feature reduction techniques; Explore the patterns in the feature data set using various clustering algorithms; and determine the suitability of the algorithm as a data mining tool.",7,"Mining nexrad radar data: An investigative study

In this work medium-range MMAE forecasts were clustered using the Ward Clustering algorithm, and the clustering examined in detail to compare the importance of ensemble perturbations and model differences in the forecast outcomes. All forecasts were bias-corrected and normalized prior to clustering to ensure that observed differences were real differences in forecast evolution, and not simply due to different model biases.

It is also shown that this algorithm includes the standard first-order method as a special case. Notwithstanding the method used in this optimization phase, if the iterative optimization is terminated prematurely before convergence (generally for the sake of economy), the resulting analysis incurs an error that will corrupt the initial condition of the model and thereby affect the forecast.

Rainfall classification using histogram analysis: An example of data mining in meteorology,"MICHAEL E Baldwin, S Lakshmivarahan",2002/11,Intelligent Engineering Systems Through Artificial Neural Networks,12,,,"The purpose of this work is to develop a robust automated classification technique to find significant and interesting features within spatial fields of meteorological data, for eventual use in a weather-related decision support system. To begin this analysis process, rainfall events are classified by analyzing the similarity of bulk statistical measures representing the distribution of rainfall values across a region of fixed size. The gamma distribution was selected to fit the observed distribution of rainfall since it is well suited for rainfall data. Due to the spatially correlated nature of rainfall, a robust method of parameter estimation of the distribution is required, therefore the generalized method of moments estimation technique was selected. Hierarchical cluster analysis is then performed using the parameters of the gamma distribution as attributes to classify the objects in the target data set, and those results are compared to a subjective classification of the rainfall patterns. The results show that this system successfully classified the cases in the target data set into convective and non-convective events with over 90% accuracy. However, further refinement of the classification was less successful and leaves room for future improvement.

Traditionally,"" objective"" forecast verification is performed by an automated system which compares values of forecast and observed variables valid at the same set of points in both time and space. The forecast values are compared to the observed values, and various statistics are computed to measure the accuracy of the forecast field. For meteorological fields that contain high-amplitude, small-scale features, small forecast errors in phase, displacement, or time lag can produce very large differences between forecast and observed scalar variables at specific locations. Traditional approaches to verification may actually represent a forecast system that never predicts small-scale, highamplitude features as more accurate than one that predicts realistic features (Baldwin et al. 2001). For example, it is possible for a thunderstorm to produce 50mm of rain at one location, while 10km to the south no rain is observed. A forecast that correctly called for this highamplitude spatial variation in rainfall except with a southward displacement error of 10km would find that the mean absolute error (MAE) from these two locations would be 50mm. Another forecast that called for 10mm at both locations would have a smaller MAE of 25mm, but this forecast does not accurately represent the spatial variation found in the observed …",20,"Development of an"" events-oriented"" approach to forecast verification

A linear output capacitance assumption, combined with PSpice simulations, is used to investigate the power consumption in the parallel prefix circuits. The degrees of freedom studied include different parallel prefix algorithms and voltage scaling. The results show that the use of the linear output capacitance assumption provides results that are consistent with those obtained using PSpice simulations.

The Cooperative Radar Acquisition Field Test (CRAFT) project was established to begin addressing the need for real-time access of the data by an ever-growing user community. The principle goal of CRAFT is the development of a national prototype demonstrating the real-time compression, delivery, and Internet-based transmission of WSR-88D Archive Level II data from multiple radars with a view toward nationwide implementation [2].
Presently radar data are archived on-site using 8 mm tape. Once a tape is filled, it is sent to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for permanent archival. The main disadvantages of this technology are the unreliability of the tape drives, the expense of maintaining the on-site equipment, and the reliance upon NWS technicians to change the tapes and mail them to NCDC. A secondary goal of CRAFT is to eliminate the need for in situ archival of radar data. In essence, radar data collection would shift from on-site to a designated off-site centralized repository, NCDC.",1,"Compression of NEXRAD (WSR-88D) Radar Data Using Burrows-Wheeler Algorithm

In this particular application, solutions to systems of elliptic equations are the essence of the computational mechanics. One set of equations is associated with the decomposition of the wind into irrotational and nondivergent components—this determines the initial nondivergent state. Another set is associated with recovery of the streamfunction from the forecasted vorticity. We demonstrate that direct parallel methods based on accelerated block cyclic reduction (BCR) significantly reduce the computational time required to solve the elliptic equations germane to this decomposition and forecast problem.

The former class coincides with the class of b-ary b=2/sup l/ hypercubes, and the latter denotes a new class of interconnection.

Parallel algorithms for ranking of trees,"Y Liang, Sudarshan K Dhall, S Lakshmivarahan",1990/12/9,,,,IEEE,"Ranking a tree is defined as a mapping rho of the nodes to the set (1, 2, . . .) such that if there is a path from u to v and rho (u)= rho (v) then there is a node w on the path from u to v such that rho (w)> rho (u). The highest number assigned to the node is called the rank number of the mapping. A mapping rho with the smallest rank number is called optimal ranking. The best known serial algorithm takes O(n) time for the optimal node ranking. However, the problem of finding the optimal tree ranking appears to be highly sequential. It remains open whether it is in NC. The paper proposes a fast parallel algorithm for finding approximate optimal node ranking of trees using O(logn) steps with n/sup 2/ processors on a CRCW PRAM and an efficient parallel algorithm using O(log/sup 2/n) steps with n processors on a EREW model.< >",9,"Parallel algorithms for ranking of trees

An NC algorithm for the domination in permutation graphs,"C Rhee, SK Dhall, S Lakshmivarahan",1990,28th Annual Allerton Conference,,,,"Let G=(V, E) be an undirected graph and let D, and D2 be subsets of V. Then D₁ is said to dominate D2 if each vertex in D2 is adjacent to some vertex in D₁. A subset DV is called a dominating set for G if D dominates V-D. A graph G is called a weighted graph if there exists a weight function w: V→ R (the set of reals), where w (v) is called the weight of vertex v. In this paper, we assume that all vertices have weight greater than 0. Let W (D)= Σw (v). A dominating set DV is called a minimum weight dominating set for G if W (D)= min {W (D)| D CV and D is a dominating set for G.). Let< n>={1, 2,..., n) and п=(п (1) п (2) П (n)) be a permutation on< n>. For a given permutation П, we construct an undirected graph G (II)=(< n>, E), where i je E if and only if (i− j)(T− ¹ (i)− II− ¹ (j))< 0. Any undirected graph G is called a permutation graph if there exists a II such that G is isomorphic to G (TT), ie G≈ G (M). The permutation graph G=(V, E) will be denoted as G=(П (1) П (2)··· П (n)) in this paper, where II is the underlying permutation for G. Farber and Keil [1] developed O (n³) sequential algorithms for finding a minimum weight dominating set and a maximum weight independent set in permutation graphs. They also described an O (n) algorithm for the minimum cardinality dominating set problem. Atallah and Kosaraju [2] described an O (n log n) algorithm for finding a minimum weight independent dominating set, which improved one of the Farber and Keil's results. In this paper we present an NC algorithm for finding a minimum weight dominating set in permutation graphs. This result is interesting since there exists no known NC algorithm for this problem and the …",6,"An NC algorithm for the domination in permutation graphs

An optimal parallel algorithm for the maximal element problem,"C Rhee, Sudarshan K Dhall, S Lakshmivarahan",1990/1/1,,,,,"Given a set (p1, p2, …, pn) of n points in a plane, a point pi dominates another point pj iff X (pi) ≥ X(pj) and Y (pi) ≥ Y(pj) where X (p) and Y (p) denote the coordinates of a point p. Our problem is to find the points which are dominated by no other point. These points are called maximal elements. In this abstract we suggest an Ο (log n) parallel algorithm with Ο (n) processors in the EREW parallel model which is weaker than CREW. (Note that most parallel algorithms in the literature use the power of CREW PRAM model.) The main idea is to reduce the problem to the parallel prefix problem [2]. Our algorithm runs as follows: First, from P = {pl, …, pn}, find a subset P' = {p1 …, pm }, where each point pi is dominated by no other point having the same X -coordinate aspi. This can be done in Ο (log n) time with Ο (n) processors in the EREW model applying the parallel sort algorithm by [1]. Next sort P' according to the X …",1,"An optimal parallel algorithm for the maximal element problem

A new hierarchy of hypercube interconnection schemes for parallel computers,"S Lakshmivarahan, Sudarshan K Dhall",1988/9,The journal of Supercomputing,2,,Kluwer Academic Publishers,"This paper introduces a new hierarchy of cube-based interconnection schemes, called the base-b cube (which properly contains the well-known binary cube), for the design of parallel computers. This hierarchy admits a recursive definition and allows many more reconfigurations than are possible with the binary cube. Our analysis addresses the inherent cost-delay trade-off for this hierarchy along with a number of related topological properties such as sparsity, diameter, existence of node disjoint paths, and odd and even cycles. Embeddings of standard interconnection schemes including linear and two-dimensional arrays, rings, and complete binary trees in a base-b cube are illustrated.",68,"A new hierarchy of hypercube interconnection schemes for parallel computers
