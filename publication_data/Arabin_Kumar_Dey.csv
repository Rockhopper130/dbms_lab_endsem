Confidence Interval Construction for Multivariate time series using Long Short Term Memory Network,"Aryan Bhambu, Arabin Kumar Dey",2022/11/25,arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.13915,,,,In this paper we propose a novel procedure to construct a confidence interval for multivariate time series predictions using long short term memory network. The construction uses a few novel block bootstrap techniques. We also propose an innovative block length selection procedure for each of these schemes. Two novel benchmarks help us to compare the construction of this confidence intervals by different bootstrap techniques. We illustrate the whole construction through S\&P and Dow Jones Index datasets.,0,"Confidence Interval Construction for Multivariate time series using Long Short Term Memory Network

Integrated Brier Score based Survival Cobra--A regression based approach,"Rahul Goswami, Arabin Kumar Dey",2022/10/21,arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.12006,,,,"In this paper, we provide two novel regression-based integrations of combined regression strategy (COBRA) ensemble using Integrated Brier Score to predict conditional survival function. Our proposition includes a weighted version of all predictions based on Integrated Brier Score score made by all weak learners to predict the final survival function apart from the straight implementation. Two different norms (Frobenius and Sup norm) used to figure out the proximity points in the algorithm. Our implementations consider right-censored data too.

Concordance based Survival Cobra with regression type weak learners,"Rahul Goswami, Arabin Kumar Dey",2022/9/24,arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.11919,,,,"In this paper, we predict conditional survival functions through a combined regression strategy. We take weak learners as different random survival trees. We propose to maximize concordance in the right-censored set up to find the optimal parameters. We explore two approaches, a usual survival cobra and a novel weighted predictor based on the concordance index.

Modeling long-term groundwater levels by exploring deep bidirectional long short-term memory using hydro-climatic data,"Sangita Dey, Arabin Kumar Dey, Rajesh Kumar Mall",2021/8,Water Resources Management,35,,Springer Netherlands,"Inevitable issues concerning the sustainability of groundwater resources are crucial under the present climatic situation. Therefore, the prevision of groundwater environments may able to reinforce the management system. In this respect present study considered a new method to predict long-term groundwater level framework as an alternative option of expensive physical models. The proposed Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) model can efficiently capture Spatio-temporal features from historical data. A highway LSTM network is also introduced within the architecture of the model to optimize the analysis. The relative performance of the proposed BLSTM with the highway LSTM (BHLSTM) network compared with simple BLSTM.

Study Site: The present study was carried out in Durgapur, also known as ‘steel city’of West Bengal, India. The city covers an area of 154 km2 and is situated at the transition zone between Chotanagpur plateau and Gangetic plains (23.480N, 87.320E, elevation 65 m MSL). The region is represented by dry deciduous forest of Shorea robusta (Champion & Seth 1968), scrubland and a few agricultural lands of poor laterite soil. Presently the landscape has been changed by various human activities and has a large number of small and heavy industries which includes the Durgapur Steel Plant, Alloy Steel Plant, Durgapur Thermal Power Station and Durgapur Projects Limited. A large dam and various reserves have been constructed for water supply and flood control for the inhabitants of Durgapur and its surrounding regions. The city is both interspersed and surrounded by several forest patches (Nayak & Roy 2016).

The two singular bivariate distributions functions have very similar joint probability density functions.
