Implicit feedback policies for COVID-19: why “zero-COVID” policies remain elusive,"Ali Jadbabaie, Arnab Sarker, Devavrat Shah",2023/2/23,Scientific Reports,13,1,Nature Publishing Group UK,"Successful epidemic modeling requires understanding the implicit feedback control strategies used by populations to modulate the spread of contagion. While such strategies can be replicated with intricate modeling assumptions, here we propose a simple model where infection dynamics are described by a three parameter feedback policy. Rather than model individuals as directly controlling the contact rate which governs the spread of disease, we model them as controlling the contact rate’s derivative, resulting in a dynamic rather than kinematic model. The feedback policy used by populations across the United States which best fits observations is proportional-derivative control, where learned parameters strongly correlate with observed interventions (e.g., vaccination rates and mobility restrictions). However, this results in a non-zero “steady-state” of case counts, implying current mitigation strategies cannot …",0,"Implicit feedback policies for COVID-19: why “zero-COVID” policies remain elusive

Matrix Estimation for Individual Fairness,"Cindy Y Zhang, Sarah H Cen, Devavrat Shah",2023/2/4,arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.02096,,,,"In recent years, multiple notions of algorithmic fairness have arisen. One such notion is individual fairness (IF), which requires that individuals who are similar receive similar treatment. In parallel, matrix estimation (ME) has emerged as a natural paradigm for handling noisy data with missing values. In this work, we connect the two concepts. We show that pre-processing data using ME can improve an algorithm's IF without sacrificing performance. Specifically, we show that using a popular ME method known as singular value thresholding (SVT) to pre-process the data provides a strong IF guarantee under appropriate conditions. We then show that, under analogous conditions, SVT pre-processing also yields estimates that are consistent and approximately minimax optimal. As such, the ME pre-processing step does not, under the stated conditions, increase the prediction error of the base algorithm, i.e., does not impose a fairness-performance trade-off. We verify these results on synthetic and real data.",0,"Matrix Estimation for Individual Fairness

Robust Max Entrywise Error Bounds for Tensor Estimation from Sparse Observations via Similarity Based Collaborative Filtering,"Devavrat Shah, Christina Lee Yu",2023/1/16,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,,,IEEE,"Consider the task of estimating a 3-order n × n × n tensor from noisy observations of randomly chosen entries in the sparse regime. We introduce a similarity based collaborative filtering algorithm for estimating a tensor from sparse observations and argue that it achieves sample complexity that nearly matches the conjectured computationally efficient lower bound on the sample complexity for the setting of low-rank tensors. Our algorithm uses the matrix obtained from the flattened tensor to compute similarity, and estimates the tensor entries using a nearest neighbor estimator. We prove that the algorithm recovers a finite rank tensor with maximum entry-wise error (MEE) and mean-squared-error (MSE) decaying to 0 as long as each entry is observed independently with probability p = Ω( n –3/2+κ ) for any arbitrarily small κ > 0.

We consider studies with unobserved confounding which introduces statistical biases between interventions and outcomes as well as exacerbates the heterogeneity across units. Modeling the underlying joint distribution as an exponential family and under suitable conditions, we reduce learning the unit-level counterfactual distributions to learning exponential family distributions with heterogeneous parameters and only one sample per distribution. We introduce a convex objective that pools all samples to jointly learn all parameters and provide a unit-wise mean squared error bound that scales linearly with the metric entropy of the parameter space.

Causal imputation via synthetic interventions,"Chandler Squires, Dennis Shen, Anish Agarwal, Devavrat Shah, Caroline Uhler",2022/6/28,,,,PMLR,"Consider the problem of determining the effect of a compound on a specific cell type. To answer this question, researchers traditionally need to run an experiment applying the drug of interest to that cell type. This approach is not scalable: given a large number of different actions (compounds) and a large number of different contexts (cell types), it is infeasible to run an experiment for every action-context pair. In such cases, one would ideally like to predict the outcome for every pair while only needing outcome data for a small _subset_ of pairs. This task, which we label"" causal imputation"", is a generalization of the causal transportability problem. To address this challenge, we extend the recently introduced _synthetic interventions_ (SI) estimator to handle more general data sparsity patterns. We prove that, under a latent factor model, our estimator provides valid estimates for the causal imputation task. We motivate this model by establishing a connection to the linear structural causal model literature. Finally, we consider the prominent CMAP dataset in predicting the effects of compounds on gene expression across cell types. We find that our estimator outperforms standard baselines, thus confirming its utility in biological applications.",12,"Causal imputation via synthetic interventions

In this paper, we leverage such low-rank structure to reduce the high computational cost of canonical gradient-based methods such as gradient descent (GD).

We establish that the ""directional oracle complexities"" of LRGD for strongly convex and non-convex objective functions are and , respectively. When , these complexities are smaller than the known complexities of and of {\gd} in the strongly convex and non-convex settings, respectively.

We build on a line of work that models this setting as a two-sided matching market with bandit learners. A recent result in this area states that it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee two natural desiderata: stability and low optimal regret for all agents. Resource-allocating platforms can point to this result as a justification for assigning good long-term outcomes to some agents and poor ones to others. We show that this impossibility need not hold true. In particular, by modeling two additional components of competition—namely, costs and transfers—we prove that it is possible to simultaneously guarantee four desiderata: stability, low optimal regret, fairness in the distribution of regret, and high social welfare.",22,"Regret, stability & fairness in matching markets with bandit learners

Current Implicit Policies May Not Eradicate COVID-19,"Ali Jadbabaie, Arnab Sarker, Devavrat Shah",2022/3/29,arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.15916,,,,"Successful predictive modeling of epidemics requires an understanding of the implicit feedback control strategies which are implemented by populations to modulate the spread of contagion. While this task of capturing endogenous behavior can be achieved through intricate modeling assumptions, we find that a population's reaction to case counts can be described through a second order affine dynamical system with linear control which fits well to the data across different regions and times throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The model fits the data well both in and out of sample across the 50 states of the United States, with comparable scores to state of the art ensemble predictions. In contrast to recent models of epidemics, rather than assuming that individuals directly control the contact rate which governs the spread of disease, we assume that individuals control the rate at which they vary their number of interactions, i.e. they control the derivative of the contact rate. We propose an implicit feedback law for this control input and verify that it correlates with policies taken throughout the pandemic. A key takeaway of the dynamical model is that the ""stable"" point of case counts is non-zero, i.e. COVID-19 will not be eradicated under the current collection of policies and strategies, and additional policies are needed to fully eradicate it quickly. Hence, we suggest alternative implicit policies which focus on making interventions (such as vaccinations and mobility restrictions) a function of cumulative case counts, for which our results suggest a better possibility of eradicating COVID-19.",0,"Current Implicit Policies May Not Eradicate COVID-19

Counterfactual inference for sequential experimental design,"Raaz Dwivedi, Susan Murphy, Devavrat Shah",2022/2/14,arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.06891,,,,"We consider the problem of counterfactual inference in sequentially designed experiments wherein a collection of units each undergo a sequence of interventions for time periods, based on policies that sequentially adapt over time. Our goal is counterfactual inference, i.e., estimate what would have happened if alternate policies were used, a problem that is inherently challenging due to the heterogeneity in the outcomes across units and time. To tackle this task, we introduce a suitable latent factor model where the potential outcomes are determined by exogenous unit and time level latent factors. Under suitable conditions, we show that it is possible to estimate the missing (potential) outcomes using a simple variant of nearest neighbors. First, assuming a bilinear latent factor model and allowing for an arbitrary adaptive sampling policy, we establish a distribution-free non-asymptotic guarantee for estimating the missing outcome of any unit at any time; under suitable regularity condition, this guarantee implies that our estimator is consistent. Second, for a generic non-parametric latent factor model, we establish that the estimate for the missing outcome of any unit at time satisfies a central limit theorem as , under suitable regularity conditions. Finally, en route to establishing this central limit theorem, we establish a non-asymptotic mean-squared-error bound for the estimate of the missing outcome of any unit at time .

Unifying Epidemic Models with Mixtures,"Arnab Sarker, Ali Jadbabaie, Devavrat Shah",2022/1/7,arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.04960,,,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for a robust understanding of epidemic models. Current models of epidemics are classified as either mechanistic or non-mechanistic: mechanistic models make explicit assumptions on the dynamics of disease, whereas non-mechanistic models make assumptions on the form of observed time series. Here, we introduce a simple mixture-based model which bridges the two approaches while retaining benefits of both. The model represents time series of cases and fatalities as a mixture of Gaussian curves, providing a flexible function class to learn from data compared to traditional mechanistic models.

Federated optimization of smooth loss functions,"Ali Jadbabaie, Anuran Makur, Devavrat Shah",2022/1/6,arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.01954,,,,"In this work, we study empirical risk minimization (ERM) within a federated learning framework, where a central server minimizes an ERM objective function using training data that is stored across clients. In this setting, the Federated Averaging (FedAve) algorithm is the staple for determining -approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this additional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent (FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank structure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server can use to approximate clients' gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM problem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can have superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle complexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity. Under some assumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity in parameter, -H\""older smoothness in data, etc., we prove that the federated oracle complexity of FedLRGD scales like and that of FedAve scales like (neglecting sub-dominant factors), where is a ""communication-to-computation ratio,"" is the parameter dimension, and is the data dimension.

Randomized control trials (RCT) are expensive and inaccessible to most researchers, while expert-designed simulators fail to capture complex behaviors in real networks. We present CausalSim, a data-driven simulator for network protocols that addresses this challenge. Learning network behavior from observational data is complicated due to the bias introduced by the protocols used during data collection. CausalSim uses traces from an initial RCT under a set of protocols to learn a causal network model, effectively removing the biases present in the data. Using this model, CausalSim can then simulate any protocol over the same traces (i.e., for counterfactual predictions). Key to CausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits distributional invariances that are present due to the training data coming from an RCT. Our extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic datasets and two use cases, including more than nine months of real data from the Puffer video streaming system, shows that it provides accurate counterfactual predictions, reducing prediction error by 44% and 53% on average compared to expert-designed and standard supervised learning baselines.",3,"Causalsim: Toward a causal data-driven simulator for network protocols

Current Implicit Policies May Not Eradicate COVID-19 (preprint),"Ali Jadbabaie, Arnab Sarker, Devavrat Shah",2022,,,,,"Successful predictive modeling of epidemics requires an understanding of the implicit feedback control strategies which are implemented by populations to modulate the spread of contagion. While this task of capturing endogenous behavior can be achieved through intricate modeling assumptions, we find that a population's reaction to case counts can be described through a second order affine dynamical system with linear control which fits well to the data across different regions and times throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The model fits the data well both in and out of sample across the 50 states of the United States, with comparable scores to state of the art ensemble predictions. In contrast to recent models of epidemics, rather than assuming that individuals directly control the contact rate which governs the spread of disease, we assume that individuals control the rate at which they vary their number of interactions, ie they control the derivative of the contact rate. We propose an implicit feedback law for this control input and verify that it correlates with policies taken throughout the pandemic. A key takeaway of the dynamical model is that the"" stable"" point of case counts is non-zero, ie COVID-19 will not be eradicated under the current collection of policies and strategies, and additional policies are needed to fully eradicate it quickly. Hence, we suggest alternative implicit policies which focus on making interventions (such as vaccinations and mobility restrictions) a function of cumulative case counts, for which our results suggest a better possibility of eradicating COVID-19.",0,"Current Implicit Policies May Not Eradicate COVID-19 (preprint)

To answer this question, researchers traditionally need to run an experiment applying the drug of interest to that cell type. This approach is not scalable: given a large number of different actions (compounds) and a large number of different contexts (cell types), it is infeasible to run an experiment for every action-context pair. In such cases, one would ideally like to predict the outcome for every pair while only needing outcome data for a small _subset_ of pairs. This task, which we label ""causal imputation"", is a generalization of the causal transportability problem. To address this challenge, we extend the recently introduced _synthetic interventions_ (SI) estimator to handle more general data sparsity patterns. We prove that, under a latent factor model, our estimator provides valid estimates for the causal imputation task. We motivate this model by establishing a connection to the linear structural causal model literature. Finally, we consider the prominent CMAP dataset in predicting the effects of compounds on gene expression across cell types.

Change Point Detection via Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis,"Arwa Alanqary, Abdullah Alomar, Devavrat Shah",2021/12/6,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,34,,,"The objective of change point detection (CPD) is to detect significant and abrupt changes in the dynamics of the underlying system of interest through multivariate time series observations. In this work, we develop and analyze an algorithm for CPD that is inspired by a variant of the classical singular spectrum analysis (SSA) approach for time series by combining it with the classical cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic from sequential hypothesis testing. In particular, we model the underlying dynamics of multivariate time series observations through the spatio-temporal model introduced recently in the multivariate SSA (mSSA) literature. The change point in such a setting corresponds to a change in the underlying spatio-temporal model. As the primary contributions of this work, we develop an algorithm based on CUSUM-statistic to detect such change points in an online fashion. We extend the analysis of CUSUM statistics, traditionally done for the setting of independent observations, to the dependent setting of (multivariate) time series under the spatio-temporal model. Specifically, for a given parameter , our method achieves the following desirable trade-off: when a change happens, it detects it within time delay on average, while in the absence of change, it does not declare false detection for at least time length on average. We conduct empirical experiments using benchmark and synthetic datasets.

This influence has drawn scrutiny, with many calling for regulations on filtering algorithms, but designing and enforcing regulations remains challenging. In this work, we examine three questions. First, given a regulation, how would one design an audit to enforce it? Second, does the audit impose a performance cost on the platform? Third, how does the audit affect the content that the platform is incentivized to filter? In response to these questions, we propose a method such that, given a regulation, an auditor can test whether that regulation is met with only black-box access to the filtering algorithm. We then turn to the platform's perspective. The platform's goal is to maximize an objective function while meeting regulation. We find that there are conditions under which the regulation does not place a high performance cost on the platform and, notably, that content diversity can play a key role in aligning the interests of the platform and regulators.",13,"Regulating algorithmic filtering on social media

Causal matrix completion,"Anish Agarwal, Munther Dahleh, Devavrat Shah, Dennis Shen",2021/9/30,arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.15154,,,,"Matrix completion is the study of recovering an underlying matrix from a sparse subset of noisy observations. Traditionally, it is assumed that the entries of the matrix are ""missing completely at random"" (MCAR), i.e., each entry is revealed at random, independent of everything else, with uniform probability. This is likely unrealistic due to the presence of ""latent confounders"", i.e., unobserved factors that determine both the entries of the underlying matrix and the missingness pattern in the observed matrix. For example, in the context of movie recommender systems -- a canonical application for matrix completion -- a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is unlikely to ever watch horror films. In general, these confounders yield ""missing not at random"" (MNAR) data, which can severely impact any inference procedure that does not correct for this bias. We develop a formal causal model for matrix completion through the language of potential outcomes, and provide novel identification arguments for a variety of causal estimands of interest. We design a procedure, which we call ""synthetic nearest neighbors"" (SNN), to estimate these causal estimands. We prove finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator. Our analysis also leads to new theoretical results for the matrix completion literature. In particular, we establish entry-wise, i.e., max-norm, finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality results for matrix completion with MNAR data. As a special case, this also provides entry-wise bounds for matrix completion with MCAR data.

A major goal of this literature has been to compare different algorithms, such as gradient descent (GD) or stochastic gradient descent (SGD), by analyzing their rates of convergence to -approximate solutions. For example, the oracle complexity of GD is , where is the number of training samples. When is large, this can be expensive in practice, and SGD is preferred due to its oracle complexity of . Such standard analyses only utilize the smoothness of the loss function in the parameter being optimized. In contrast, we demonstrate that when the loss function is smooth in the data, we can learn the oracle at every iteration and beat the oracle complexities of both GD and SGD in important regimes. Specifically, at every iteration, our proposed algorithm performs local polynomial regression to learn the gradient of the loss function, and then estimates the true gradient of the ERM objective function. We establish that the oracle complexity of our algorithm scales like (neglecting sub-dominant factors), where and are the data and parameter space dimensions, respectively, and the gradient of the loss function belongs to a -H\""{o}lder class with respect to the data. Our proof extends the analysis of local polynomial regression in non-parametric statistics to provide interpolation guarantees in multivariate settings, and also exploits tools from the inexact GD literature.

Under suitable conditions, we establish that PCR identifies the unique linear model parameter with minimum -norm, and derive non-asymptotic -rates of convergence that show its consistency. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm for out-of-sample predictions in the presence of corrupted data that uses PCR as a key subroutine, and provide its non-asymptotic prediction performance guarantees.

On May 4, 2020, India started the process of releasing its population from a national lockdown during which extreme social distancing was implemented. We describe and simulate an adaptive control approach to exit this situation, while maintaining the epidemic under control. Adaptive control is a flexible countercyclical policy approach, whereby different areas release from lockdown in potentially different gradual ways, dependent on the local progression of the dis-ease. Because of these features, adaptive control requires the ability to decrease or increase social distancing in response to observed and projected dynamics of the disease outbreak. We show via simulation of a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and of a synthetic intervention (SI) model that adaptive control performs at least as well as immediate and full release from lockdown starting May 4 and as full release from lockdown after a month (ie, after May 31). The key insight is that adaptive response provides the option to increase or decrease socioeconomic activity depending on how it affects disease progression and this freedom allows it to do at least as well as most other policy alternatives. We also discuss the central challenge to any nuanced release policy, including adaptive control, specifically learning how specific policies translate into changes in contact rates and thus COVID-19's reproductive rate in real time.",20,"Adaptive control of COVID-19 outbreaks in India: Local, gradual, and trigger-based exit paths from lockdown

Stable reinforcement learning with unbounded state space,"Devavrat Shah, Qiaomin Xie, Zhi Xu",2020/6/8,arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.04353,,,,"We consider the problem of reinforcement learning (RL) with unbounded state space motivated by the classical problem of scheduling in a queueing network. Traditional policies as well as error metric that are designed for finite, bounded or compact state space, require infinite samples for providing any meaningful performance guarantee (e.g. error) for unbounded state space. That is, we need a new notion of performance metric. As the main contribution of this work, inspired by the literature in queuing systems and control theory, we propose stability as the notion of ""goodness"": the state dynamics under the policy should remain in a bounded region with high probability. As a proof of concept, we propose an RL policy using Sparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle and argue that it satisfies the stability property as long as the system dynamics under the optimal policy respects a Lyapunov function. The assumption of existence of a Lyapunov function is not restrictive as it is equivalent to the positive recurrence or stability property of any Markov chain, i.e., if there is any policy that can stabilize the system then it must possess a Lyapunov function. And, our policy does not utilize the knowledge of the specific Lyapunov function. To make our method sample efficient, we provide an improved, sample efficient Sparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle with Lipschitz value function that may be of interest in its own right. Furthermore, we design an adaptive version of the algorithm, based on carefully constructed statistical tests, which finds the correct tuning parameter automatically.",5,"Stable reinforcement learning with unbounded state space

We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist, the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the method leverages information from different interventions that have already been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility restrictions to create a ""synthetic low mobility U.S."" and predict the counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar intervention.

Is it luck or skill: establishing role of skill in mutual fund management and fantasy sports,"Vishal Misra, Devavrat Shah, VS Ranganathan",2020,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,,,,"The emergence of Online Fantasy Sports Platforms (OFSP) has presented a challenge for the regulatory bodies across the globe: do they represent game of skill or game of chance? A game of skill is a game where the outcome is determined mainly by the predominance of mental or physical skill, rather than chance. Gambling or a game of chance is where outcomes are entirely driven by luck and skill has no role to play. In this work, we present a novel data-driven test that helps address this question. In particular, the failure of the test leads to the conclusion that the outcomes are based on the predominance of skill, and not based on luck.
The proposed test is based on a sound statistical hypothesis of chance that we introduce. It is robust against all sorts of biases that might be present in the data. We apply the test to data obtained from two fantasy sports platforms: Dream11 for Cricket and FanDuel for Basketball. In both cases, we conclude that there is overwhelming evidence that the outcomes are driven by the predominance of skill. Indeed, evidence of “survivor bias” can be found in such dataset suggesting the importance of a robust statistical approach presented in this work.

Our algorithm uses the matrix obtained from the flattened tensor to compute similarity, and estimates the tensor entries using a nearest neighbor estimator.

Approximately Reversible Stochastic Processing Networks,Devavrat Shah,2019/7,INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference,,,,"The property of (quasi-)reversibility of Markov chains have led to elegant characterization of steady-state distribution for complex queueing networks, e.g. celebrated Jackson networks, BCMP (Baskett, Chandi, Muntz, Palacois) and Kelly theorem. In a nutshell, despite the complicated interaction, in the steady-state, the queues in such networks exhibit independence and subsequently lead to explicit calculations of distributional properties of the queuing network that may seem impossible at the outset. The model of stochastic processing network (cf. Harrison 2000) captures variety of dynamic resource allocation problems including the flow-level networks used for modeling bandwidth sharing in the Internet, switched networks (cf. Shah, Wischik 2006) for modeling packet scheduling in the Internet router and wireless medium access, and hybrid flow-packet networks for modeling job-and-packet level scheduling in data centers. Unlike before, an appropriate resource allocation or scheduling policy is required in such networks to achieve good performance. Given the complexity, asymptotic analytic approaches such as fluid model or Lyapunov-Foster criteria to establish positive-recurrence and heavy traffic or diffusion approximation to characterize the scaled steady-state distribution became method of choice. A remarkable progress has been made along these lines over the past few decades, but there is a need for much more to match the explicit calculations in the context of reversible networks.

Still, there are major inefficiencies in how data is transacted online: (1) users don't decide what information is released nor get paid for this privacy loss; (2) algorithmic advertisers are stuck in inefficient long-term contracts where they purchase user data without knowing the value it provides. This paper proposes a system, Zorro, which aims to rectify aforementioned two problems. As the main contribution, we provide a natural, 'absolute' definition of 'Value of Data' (VoD) - for any quantity of interest, it is the delta between an individual's value and population mean. The challenge remains how to operationalize this definition, independently of a buyer's model for VoD. We propose a model-agnostic solution, relying on matrix estimation, and use it to estimate click-through-rate (CTR), as an example. Regarding (2), Zorro empowers advertisers to measure value of user data on a query-by-query basis and based only on the increase in accuracy it provides in estimating CTR. In contrast advertisers currently engage in inefficient long-term data contracts with third party data sellers. We highlight two results on a large ad-click dataset: (i) our system has R^2=0.58, in line with best-in-class results for related problems (e.g. content recommendation). Crucially, our system is model-agnostic - we estimate CTR without accessing an advertiser's proprietary models, a required property of any such pricing system;(ii) our experiments show selling user data has incremental value ranging from 30%-69% depending on ad category.

For this setup, we propose an algorithm that utilizes matrix estimation on the corrupted data as a key subroutine, and then performs ordinary least squares regression with the de-noised covariates. If we instantiate the matrix estimation subroutine with hard singular value thresholding (HSVT), then our results indicate that as long as the number of samples scales as ρ− 4r log5 (p), then our in-and out-ofsample prediction error decays to 0 as p→∞; here, ρ represents the fraction of observed (noisy) covariates, r is the (approximate) rank of the true covariate matrix, and p denotes the ambient dimension (number of predictors). As an important byproduct of our approach, we demonstrate that HSVT with regression acts as a form of implicit ℓ0-regularization since HSVT aims to find a lowrank structure within the covariance matrix. Thus, we can view the sparsity of the regression vector as a consequence of the covariate structure rather than a model assumption as is often considered in the literature. Moreover, under HSVT, our finite sample bounds match (up to log4 (p) factors) the best guaranteed sample complexity results in the literature for algorithms that require precise knowledge of the underlying model; we highlight that our approach, in contrast, is model agnostic.

On robustness of principal component regression,"Anish Agarwal, Devavrat Shah, Dennis Shen, Dogyoon Song",2019,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,32,,,"Consider the setting of Linear Regression where the observed response variables, in expectation, are linear functions of the p-dimensional covariates. Then to achieve vanishing prediction error, the number of required samples scales faster than pσ2, where σ2 is a bound on the noise variance. In a high-dimensional setting where p is large but the covariates admit a low-dimensional representation (say r≪ p), then Principal Component Regression (PCR), cf.[36], is an effective approach; here, the response variables are regressed with respect to the principal components of the covariates. The resulting number of required samples to achieve vanishing prediction error now scales faster than rσ2 (≪ pσ2). Despite the tremendous utility of PCR, its ability to handle settings with noisy, missing, and mixed (discrete and continuous) valued covariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge, cf.[24]. As the main contribution of this work, we address this challenge by rigorously establishing that PCR is robust to noisy, sparse, and possibly mixed valued covariates. Specifically, under PCR, vanishing prediction error is achieved with the number of samples scaling as r max (σ2, ρ− 4 log5 (p)), where ρ denotes the fraction of observed (noisy) covariates. We establish generalization error bounds on the performance of PCR, which provides a systematic approach in selecting the correct number of components r in a data-driven manner.

Despite the success of RUMs in various domains and the versatility of mixture RUMs to capture the heterogeneity in preferences, there has been only limited progress in learning a mixture of RUMs from partial data such as pairwise comparisons. In contrast, there have been significant advances in terms of learning a single component RUM using pairwise comparisons. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap between mixture learning and single component learning of RUM by developing a `reduction' procedure. We propose to utilize PCA-based spectral clustering that simultaneously `de-noises' pairwise comparison data. We prove that our algorithm manages to cluster the partial data correctly (i.e., comparisons from the same RUM component are grouped in the same cluster) with high probability even when data is generated from a possibly {\em heterogeneous} mixture of well-separated {\em generic} RUMs. Both the time and the sample complexities scale polynomially in model parameters including the number of items. Two key features in the analysis are in establishing (1) a meaningful upper bound on the sub-Gaussian norm for RUM components embedded into the vector space of pairwise marginals and (2) the robustness of PCA with missing values in the sense, which might be of interest in their own right.",2,"Learning RUMs: Reducing Mixture to Single Component via PCA

This monograph aims to explain the success of these methods, both in theory, for which we cover foundational nonasymptotic statistical guarantees on nearest-neighbor-based regression and classification, and in practice, for which we gather prominent methods for approximate nearest neighbor search that have been essential to scaling prediction systems reliant on nearest neighbor analysis to handle massive datasets. Furthermore, we discuss connections to learning distances for use with nearest neighbor methods, including how random decision trees and ensemble methods learn nearest neighbor structure, as well as recent developments in crowdsourcing and graphons. In terms of theory, our focus is on nonasymptotic statistical guarantees, which we state in the form of how many training data and what algorithm parameters ensure that a nearest neighbor prediction method achieves a user-specified error tolerance. We begin with the most general of such results for nearest neighbor and related kernel regression and classification in general metric spaces. In such settings in which we assume very little structure, what enables successful prediction is smoothness in the function being estimated for regression, and a low probability of landing near the decision boundary for classification.

Study aimed to evaluate the Computed Tomography (CT) characteristics of SNIP and to correlate these characteristics with the finding of the origins of tumors. Material and Methods: Nasal cavity and paranasal sinus CT images of 38 patients were reviewed retrospectively to detect areas within which there was hyperostosis. We correlate SNIP characteristics with the detection of the origins of tumors described in the corresponding patient's medical records. We also assessed the CT features of hyperostosis according to the origin of tumors.
Result: Surgical evaluation of 29 lesions with hyperostosis in CT images revealed that 23 of these lesions coincided with the virtual origin of tumor. The CT-based determination of the positions of the areas of hyperostosis corresponded to the actual tumor origin in 79.3% of cases. Specifically, in cases with hyperostosis within the maxillary, frontal, posterior and sphenoid, ethmoid sinuses, areas of hyperostosis corresponded to the origin of tumor without detraction. In the evaluation of the CT characteristics of hyperostosis, two patterns of localized bone thickening were noted. Conclusion: A high association between the origin of the SNIP and hyperostosis on CT might facilitate preoperative prediction of tumor origin by rhinologists and radiologists.",1,"Computed Tomography Evaluation of Sinonasal Inverted Papilloma Characteristics with Origins of Tumors

To that end, we utilize a matrix estimation method from literature (soft-or hard-singular value thresholding). Specifically, we stack the observations (with missing values) to form a data matrix and learn a low-rank approximation of it so that the row indices can be correctly clustered to belong to appropriate mixture component using a simple distance-based algorithm. To analyze the performance of this algorithm by quantifying finite sample bound, we extend the result for matrix estimation methods in the literature in two important ways: one, noise across columns is correlated and not independent across all entries of matrix as considered in the literature; two, the performance metric of interest is the maximum i2 row norm error, which is stronger than the traditional mean-squared-error averaged over all entries. Equipped with these advances in the context of matrix estimation, we are able to connect matrix estimation and mixture model learning in the presence of missing data.",5,"Learning mixture model with missing values and its application to rankings

Current datacenter networks primarily inherit the principles that went into the design of Internet, where congestion control and scheduling are distributed. While distributed architecture provides robustness, it suffers in terms of performance. Unlike Internet, data center is fundamentally a ""controlled"" environment. This raises the possibility of designing a centralized architecture to achieve better performance. Recent solutions such as Fastpass and Flowtune have provided the proof of this concept. This raises the question: what is theoretically optimal performance achievable in a data center? We propose a centralized policy that guarantees a per-flow end-to-end flow delay bound of (#hops flow-size gap-to-capacity). Effectively such an end-to-end delay will be experienced by flows even if we removed congestion control and scheduling constraints as the resulting queueing networks can be viewed as the classical reversible multi-class queuing network, which has a product-form stationary distribution. In the language of Harrison et al., we establish that baseline performance for this model class is achievable. Indeed, as the key contribution of this work, we propose a method to emulate such a reversible queuing network while satisfying congestion control and scheduling constraints. Precisely, our policy is an emulation of Store-and-Forward (SFA) congestion control in conjunction with Last-Come-First-Serve Preemptive-Resume (LCFS-PR) scheduling policy.",1,"Centralized Congestion Control and Scheduling in a Datacenter

We model this problem as a k-choice consumption problem and introduce a simple, new approach to modeling uncertainty–the Data-Driven Prophet Model–that treads the line between stochastic and adversarial modeling, and is amenable to the very common situation where stochastic modeling is challenging, despite the availability of copious historical data. We propose a simple, scalable algorithm that is shown to be order-optimal in this setting. We deploy this algorithm in open-source software that allows buyers to achieve a dramatic reduction in costs by taking advantage of spot markets.

The reason is that congestion control decisions are distributed across the endpoints, which vary their offered load in response to changes in application demand and network feedback on a packet-by-packet basis. We propose a different approach for datacenter networks, flowlet control, in which congestion control decisions are made at the granularity of a flowlet, not a packet. With flowlet control, allocations have to change only when flowlets arrive or leave. We have implemented this idea in a system called Flowtune using a centralized allocator that receives flowlet start and end notifications from endpoints. The allocator computes optimal rates using a new, fast method for network utility maximization, and updates endpoint congestion-control parameters. Experiments show that Flowtune outperforms DCTCP, pFabric, sfqCoDel, and XCP on tail packet delays in various settings, converging to optimal rates within a few packets rather than over several RTTs. Benchmarks on an EC2 deployment show a fairer rate allocation than Linux’s Cubic.

In contrast with classical regression, the features are not observed, making it challenging to apply standard regression methods to predict the unobserved ratings.

Assuming each entry is sampled independently with probability at least with , we prove that the expected fraction of our estimates with error greater than is less than plus a polynomially decaying term, where is the variance of the additive entry-wise noise term.

For example, if A is symmetric positive definite, there is a transformation such that ρ (G)=(κ (A)− 1)/(κ (A)+ 1), where κ (A) is the condition number of A.

Forecasting with alternative data,"Guy Bresler, David Gamarnik, Devavrat Shah",2014,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,27,,,"In this paper we investigate the computational complexity of learning the graph structure underlying a discrete undirected graphical model from iid samples. Our first result is an unconditional computational lower bound of for learning general graphical models on nodes of maximum degree , for the class of statistical algorithms recently introduced by Feldman et al. The construction is related to the notoriously difficult learning parities with noise problem in computational learning theory. Our lower bound shows that the runtime required by Bresler, Mossel, and Sly's exhaustive-search algorithm cannot be significantly improved without restricting the class of models. Aside from structural assumptions on the graph such as it being a tree, hypertree, tree-like, etc., most recent papers on structure learning assume that the model has the correlation decay property. Indeed, focusing on ferromagnetic Ising models, Bento and Montanari showed that all known low-complexity algorithms fail to learn simple graphs when the interaction strength exceeds a number related to the correlation decay threshold. Our second set of results gives a class of repelling (antiferromagnetic) models that have the\emph {opposite} behavior: very strong repelling allows efficient learning in time . We provide an algorithm whose performance interpolates between and depending on the strength of the repulsion.",40,"Structure learning of antiferromagnetic Ising models

Nearest neighbors for matrix estimation interpreted as blind regression for latent variable model,"Guy Bresler, George H Chen, Devavrat Shah",2014,Advances in neural information processing systems,27,,,"Despite the prevalence of collaborative filtering in recommendation systems, there has been little theoretical development on why and how well it works, especially in the``online''setting, where items are recommended to users over time. We address this theoretical gap by introducing a model for online recommendation systems, cast item recommendation under the model as a learning problem, and analyze the performance of a cosine-similarity collaborative filtering method. In our model, each of users either likes or dislikes each of items. We assume there to be types of users, and all the users of a given type share a common string of probabilities determining the chance of liking each item. At each time step, we recommend an item to each user, where a key distinction from related bandit literature is that once a user consumes an item (eg, watches a movie), then that item cannot be recommended to the same user again. The goal is to maximize the number of likable items recommended to users over time. Our main result establishes that after nearly initial learning time steps, a simple collaborative filtering algorithm achieves essentially optimal performance without knowing . The algorithm has an exploitation step that uses cosine similarity and two types of exploration steps, one to explore the space of items (standard in the literature) and the other to explore similarity between users (novel to this work).",69,"A latent source model for online collaborative filtering

Dataset completion,"Sewoong Oh, Devavrat Shah",2014,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,27,,,"Motivated by generating personalized recommendations using ordinal (or preference) data, we study the question of learning a mixture of MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model, a parameterized class of distributions over permutations, from partial ordinal or preference data (eg pair-wise comparisons). Despite its long standing importance across disciplines including social choice, operations research and revenue management, little is known about this question. In case of single MNL models (no mixture), computationally and statistically tractable learning from pair-wise comparisons is feasible. However, even learning mixture of two MNL model is infeasible in general. Given this state of affairs, we seek conditions under which it is feasible to learn the mixture model in both computationally and statistically efficient manner. To that end, we present a sufficient condition as well as an efficient algorithm for learning mixed MNL models from partial preferences/comparisons data. In particular, a mixture of MNL components over objects can be learnt using samples whose size scales polynomially in and (concretely, , with when the model parameters are sufficiently {\em incoherent}). The algorithm has two phases: first, learn the pair-wise marginals for each component using tensor decomposition; second, learn the model parameters for each component using RankCentrality introduced by Negahban et al.

For graphical models representing a minimal exponential family, the canonical parameters are uniquely determined by the mean parameters, so the problem is feasible in principle. The goal of this paper is to investigate the computational feasibility of this statistical task. Our main result shows that parameter estimation is in general intractable: no algorithm can learn the canonical parameters of a generic pair-wise binary graphical model from the mean parameters in time bounded by a polynomial in the number of variables (unless RP= NP). Indeed, such a result has been believed to be true (see the monograph by Wainwright and Jordan) but no proof was known. Our proof gives a polynomial time reduction from approximating the partition function of the hard-core model, known to be hard, to learning approximate parameters. Our reduction entails showing that the marginal polytope boundary has an inherent repulsive property, which validates an optimization procedure over the polytope that does not use any knowledge of its structure (as required by the ellipsoid method and others).",32,"Hardness of parameter estimation in graphical models

In a nutshell, PM divides the graph into small subgraphs using our novel randomized partitioning scheme, runs the centralized algorithm on each partition separately, and then stitches the resulting solutions to produce a global solution. We demonstrate the efficiency of the PM algorithm on two popular problems: computation of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) assignment in an arbitrary pairwise Markov Random Field (MRF), and modularity optimization for community detection. We show that the resulting distributed algorithms for these problems essentially run in time linear in the number of nodes in the graph, and perform as well -- or even better -- than the original centralized algorithm as long as the graph has geometric structures. Here we say a graph has geometric structures, or polynomial growth property, when the number of nodes within distance r of any given node grows no faster than a polynomial function of r. More precisely, if the centralized algorithm is a C-factor approximation with constant C \ge 1, the resulting distributed algorithm is a (C+\delta)-factor approximation for any small \delta>0; but if the centralized algorithm is a non-constant (e.g. logarithmic) factor approximation, then the resulting distributed algorithm becomes a constant factor approximation. For general graphs, we compute explicit bounds on the loss of performance of the resulting distributed algorithm with respect to the centralized algorithm.",1,"Partition-merge: Distributed inference and modularity optimization

This protocol needs to determine how much coded data should be sent before the sender pauses for feedback from the receiver. Without such feedback, an open-loop sender would not know when the packet has been decoded, but sending this feedback is not free and consumes a significant fraction of the packet transmission time. This paper develops RateMore, a protocol that learns the …",57,"No symbol left behind: a link-layer protocol for rateless codes

The key idea in the code is the sequential application of a pseudo-random hash function to the message bits to produce a sequence of coded symbols for transmission. This encoding ensures that two input messages that differ in even one bit lead to very different coded sequences after the point at which they differ, providing good resilience to noise and bit errors. To decode spinal codes, this paper develops an approximate maximum-likelihood decoder, called the bubble decoder, which runs in time polynomial in the message size and achieves the Shannon capacity over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and binary symmetric channel (BSC) models.

For large path-loss exponent, this provides an information-theoretic scaling characterization of the entire caching capacity region. The proposed communication scheme achieving the inner bound shows that the problems of cache selection and channel coding can be solved separately without loss of order-optimality.

The main appeal of such an approach is the ease of aggregation. However, the rating scale as well as the individual ratings are often arbitrary and may not be consistent from one user to another.

We prove that spinal codes achieve Shannon capacity for the binary symmetric channel (BSC) and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with an efficient polynomial-time encoder and decoder. They are the first rateless codes with proofs of these properties for BSC and AWGN. The key idea in the spinal code is the sequential application of a hash function over the message bits. The sequential structure of the code turns out to be crucial for efficient decoding. Moreover, counter to the wisdom of having an expander structure in good codes, we show that the spinal code, despite its sequential structure, achieves capacity. The pseudo-randomness provided by a hash function suffices for this purpose. Our proof introduces a variant of Gallager's result characterizing the error exponent of random codes for any memoryless channel. We present a novel application of these error-exponent results within the framework of an efficient sequential code.

In a recent work [10], this question was introduced and studied. The authors proposed rumor centrality as an estimator for detecting the source. They establish it to be the maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the popular Susceptible Infected (SI) model with exponential spreading time for regular trees. They showed that as the size of infected graph increases, for a line (2-regular tree) graph, the probability of source detection goes to 0 while for d-regular trees with d ≥ 3 the probability of detection, say αd, remains bounded away from 0 and is less than 1/2. Their results, however stop short of providing insights for the heterogeneous setting such as irregular trees or the SI model with non-exponential spreading times. This paper overcomes this limitation and establishes the effectiveness of rumor centrality for source detection for generic random trees and the SI model with a generic spreading time distribution. The key result is an interesting connection between a multi-type continuous time branching process (an equivalent representation of a generalized Polya's urn, cf. [1]) and the effectiveness of rumor centrality. Through this, it is possible to quantify the detection probability precisely. As a consequence, we recover all the results of [10] as a special case and more importantly, we obtain a variety of results establishing the universality of rumor centrality in the context of tree-like graphs and the SI model with a generic spreading time distribution.",4,"Finding rumor sources on random graphs

An ideal solution is a rateless wireless system, in which the sender encodes data without any explicit estimation or adaptation, implicitly adapting to the level of noise or interference. In this paper, we present a novel rateless code, the spinal code, which uses a hash function over the message bits to produce pseudo-random bits that in turn can be mapped directly to a dense constellation for transmission.

We propose an algorithm for detecting community structure in networks called the leader-follower algorithm which is based upon the natural internal structure expected of communities in social networks. The algorithm uses the notion of network centrality in a novel manner to differentiate leaders (nodes which connect different communities) from loyal followers (nodes which only have neighbors within a single community). Using this approach, it is able to naturally learn the communities from the network structure and does not require the number of communities as an input, in contrast to other common methods such as spectral clustering. We prove that it will detect all of the communities exactly for any network possessing communities with the natural internal structure expected in social networks. More importantly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the leader-follower algorithm in the context of various real networks ranging from social networks such as Facebook to biological networks such as an fMRI based human brain network. We find that the leader-follower algorithm finds the relevant community structure in these networks without knowing the number of communities beforehand.

The effectiveness of a community detection algorithm is determined by accuracy in finding the ground-truth communities and ability to scale with the size of the data. In this work, we provide three contributions. First, we show that a popular measure of accuracy known as the F1 score, which is between 0 and 1, with 1 being perfect detection, has an information lower bound is 0.5. We provide a trivial algorithm that produces communities with an F1 score of 0.5 for any graph! Somewhat surprisingly, we find that popular algorithms such as modularity optimization, BigClam and CESNA have F1 scores less than 0.5 for the popular IMDB graph. To rectify this, as the second contribution we propose a generative model for community formation, the sequential community graph, which is motivated by the formation of social networks. Third, motivated by our generative model, we propose the leader-follower algorithm (LFA). We prove that it recovers all communities for sequential community graphs by establishing a structural result that sequential community graphs are chordal. For a large number of popular social networks, it recovers communities with a much higher F1 score than other popular algorithms. For the IMDB graph, it obtains an F1 score of 0.81. We also propose a modification to the LFA called the fast leader-follower algorithm (FLFA) which in addition to being highly accurate, is also fast, with a scaling that is almost linear in the network size.",3,"Leaders, followers, and community detection

It is shown that network coding can be performed in a completely online manner, without the need for batches or generations, and that such online operation does not affect the throughput. Although these ideas are presented in a single-hop packet erasure broadcast setting, they naturally extend to more general lossy networks which employ network coding in the presence of feedback. The impact of feedback on queue size at the sender and decoding delay at the receivers is studied. Strategies for adaptive coding based on feedback are presented, with the goal of minimizing the queue size and delay. The asymptotic behavior of these metrics is characterized, in the limit of the traffic load approaching capacity.

The problem in general is computationally hard (P hard). They study the quality of the approximation provided by the Bethe free energy. Belief propagation (BP) is a message-passing algorithm can be used to compute fixed points of the Bethe approximation; however, BP is not always guarantee to converge. As the first result, they propose a simple message-passing algorithm that converges to a BP fixed pont for any grapy. They find that their algorithm converges within a multiplicative error 1 + {var_epsilon} of a fixed point in {Omicron}(n{sup 2}E{sup -4} log{sup 3}(nE{sup -1})) iterations for any bounded degree graph of n nodes. In a nutshell, the algorithm can be thought of as a modification of BP with 'time-varying' message-passing. Next, they analyze the resulting error to the number of independent sets provided by such a fixed point of the Bethe approximation. Using the recently developed loop calculus approach by Vhertkov and Chernyak, they establish that for any bounded graph with large enough girth, the error is {Omicron}(n{sup -{gamma}}) for some {gamma} > 0. As an application, they find that for random 3-regular graph, Bethe approximation of log-partition function (log of the number of independent sets) is within o(1) of corret log-partition - this is quite surprising as previous physics-based predictions were expecting an error of o(n).

For more than four decades, various researchers have established the inefficiency of (the known versions of) such algorithms to varying degrees in various setups. However, the question that has remained unresolved is that of designing an algorithm that is essentially as simple and distributed as Aloha while being efficient.
In this paper, we resolve this question successfully for a network of queues when contention is modeled through independent set constraints over the network graph. The work by Tassiulas and Ephremides (1992) suggests that an algorithm that schedules queues so that the summation of “weight” of scheduled queues is maximized subject to constraints, is efficient. However, implementing such an algorithm using Aloha like mechanism has remained a mystery. We design such an algorithm building upon a Metropolis-Hastings sampling mechanism along with selection of “weight” as an appropriate function of the queue size.

That is, determine minimal structural properties of a network that are sufficient to design simple, distributed algorithms to operate a communication network efficiently. The key algorithmic tasks in a communication network pertain scheduling (physical layer) and congestion control (network layer). Recent exciting progress has led to the understanding that good algorithmic solution for joint scheduling and congestion control can be obtained via combination of the “maximum weight scheduling” of Tassiulas and Ephremides (1992) along with a rate controller inspired by flow-level resource allocation model (eg Kelly, Maullo and Tan (1998)). Since the rate controller, by design, is simple and distributed, the key algorithmic challenge lies in designing efficient implementation of “maximum weight scheduling” in the network. In general, this involves solving a network-wide hard combinatorial optimization problem (maximum weight independent set) every time. And this problem, in general is known to be computationally hard. Motivated to find algorithmically efficient networks, we characterize a large class of network structure that allow for simple, distributed algorithm design for finding approximate maximum weight independent set (or schedule). Specifically, we establish that for any network structure with geometry (ie polynomial growth of network neighborhood), an algorithm, that determines schedule of each node based information obtained from constant-depth local neighborhood, achieves essentially optimal performance.

In both formulations, nodes make partial observations of an underlying source. They communicate in order to compute a given function of all the measurements in the network, to within a desired level of error. Such computation in networks arises in various contexts, like wireless and sensor networks, consensus and belief propagation with bit constraints, and estimation of a slowly evolving process. By utilizing Information Theoretic formulations and tools, I obtain code- or algorithm-independent lower bounds that capture fundamental limits imposed by the communication network. In the first formulation, each node samples a component of a source whose values belong to a field of order q. The nodes utilize their knowledge of the joint probability mass function of the components together with the function to be computed to efficiently compress their messages, which are then broadcast. The question is: how many bits per sample are necessary and sufficient for each node to broadcast in order for the probability of decoding error to approach zero as the number of samples grows. I find that when there are two nodes in the network seeking to compute the sample-wise modulo-q sum of their measurements, a node compressing so that the other can compute the modulo-q sum is no more efficient than its compressing so that the actual data sequence is decoded. However, when there are more than two nodes, we demonstrate that there exists a joint probability mass function for which nodes can more efficiently compress so that the modulo-q …",13,"Information theoretic bounds for distributed computation

Such a Markov chain may suffer from its slow mixing time due to reversibility. Diaconis, Holmes and Neal (1997) for the ring-like chain P, and later Chen, Lovasz and Pak (2002) for an arbitrary chain P provided an explicit construction of a non-reversible Markov chain via lifting P so that its mixing time is essentially 1/Φ (P), whereΦ (P) is the conductance of P. Hence it leads to the reduction of the mixing time up to its square root. However, the construction of Chen et. al. results in expansion of size of the underlying graph during lifting; it affects the performance of algorithms (such as samplings or distributed linear dynamics) based on Markov chains. Therefore, motivated to reduce the size of the lifted chain, we provide a new lifting for an arbitrary chain based on expander graphs, which results in reduction of size up to Ω (n)(n is the number of states of P) with essentially the same mixing time.
The lifting, though allows for reduction in the mixing time, cannot be reduced beyond 1/Φ (P), given a starting Markov chain P. Therefore, if P is ill-designed to begin with, 1/Φ (P) can be large. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new notion of lifting, which we call pseudo-lifting. For an arbitrary chain P and a diameter D of its underlying graph, we provide a simple pseudo-lifting with mixing time O (D) and size O (nD)–this is the fastest possible mixing time for any Markov chain up to constant for any given underlying graph.

The vehicles are routed throughout the region to service and transport the demands such that some cost function is minimized. In the case that messages arrive with stochastic arrival times and service locations, a common cost function is the minimization of the expected time between a demand’s arrival and its service completion over an infinite time horizon.
The single stage problem is a natural probabilistic formulation of the canonical vehicle routing problem, the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). In the two stage problem, each demand must be picked up from one location and delivered to another, such as in an urban courier service. In this paper, we consider a four-stage extension of the pickup and delivery problem in which each demand is relayed once between a pickup and a delivery vehicle. In this single relay problem, each message requires four services: pickup, relay drop, relay pickup, and delivery. An example of such a problem is a courier service in which packages are dropped at a central sorting facility after pickup to be routed to the appropriate delivery vehicle.",6,"Fundamental performance limits for multi-stage vehicle routing problems

We prove that the algorithm can provide approximate solution within arbitrary accuracy when excludes some finite sized graph as its minor and G has bounded degree: all Planar graphs with bounded degree are examples of such graphs. The running time of the algorithm is (n is the number of nodes in G), with constant dependent on accuracy, degree of graph and size of the graph that is excluded as a minor (constant for Planar graphs).

We show that, if it converges, the quality of the estimate is closely related to the tightness of an LP relaxation of the MWIS problem. We use this relationship to obtain sufficient conditions for correctness of the estimate. We then develop a modification of max-product–one that converges to an optimal solution of the dual of the MWIS problem. We also develop a simple iterative algorithm for estimating the max-weight independent set from this dual solution. We show that the MWIS estimate obtained using these two algorithms in conjunction is correct when the graph is bipartite and the MWIS is unique. Finally, we show that any problem of MAP estimation for probability distributions over finite domains can be reduced to an MWIS problem. We believe this reduction will yield new insights and algorithms for MAP estimation.",23,"Message passing for max-weight independent set

The max-product (MP) and (sum-product) belief-propagation (BP) algorithm and their variants (eg tree re-weighted (TRW) algorithm) have received much recent attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness in the context of MRFs with relatively simpler structure. Despite exciting progress however, the questions of correctness, convergence, approximation guarantees and possible improvements for these algorithms remain largely unresolved. As a main result of this paper, we obtain the following surprising equivalence for any binary pair-wise MRF on a graph G: the max-marginal (resp. marginal probability) of a node, say v, in G is the same as the max-marginal (resp. marg. prob.) of the root node of the tree MRF obtained by performing a self-avoiding walk1 on G starting from v. This result can be seen as a generalization of a recent result of D. Weitz [31] for hard-core model for computing marginal probability. We obtain three very important implications of this result. First, we obtain corrections of the MP and BP algorithms in the presence of cycles to obtain exact MAP or marg. prob. by means of a message-passing algorithm unlike the complicated centralized junction-tree algorithm. Second, the algorithm for exact computation suggests a natural heuristic which by means of representative experimental results is shown to be more effective than the TRW algorithm …",21,"Inference in binary pair-wise Markov random fields through self-avoiding walks

This entropy preservation property has been well-utilized to establish non-trivial properties of discrete stochastic processes, e.g. queuing process \cite{prg03}. Entropy as well as entropy preservation is well-defined only in the context of purely discrete or continuous random variables. However for a mixture of discrete and continuous random variables, which arise in many interesting situations, the notions of entropy and entropy preservation have not been well understood. In this paper, we extend the notion of entropy in a natural manner for a mixed-pair random variable, a pair of random variables with one discrete and the other continuous. Our extensions are consistent with the existing definitions of entropy in the sense that there exist natural injections from discrete or continuous random variables into mixed-pair random variables such that their entropy remains the same. This extension of entropy allows us to obtain sufficient conditions for entropy preservation in mixtures of discrete and continuous random variables under bijections. The extended definition of entropy leads to an entropy rate for continuous time Markov chains. As an application, we recover a known probabilistic result related to Poisson process.

We show that when weights (node or edge depending on MWIS or MWM) are assigned independently according to exponential distribution, the MP algorithm converges and finds correct solution for a large range of parametric value c and r. In particular, we show that for any ǫ> 0, for large enough n, the MP becomes 1+ ǫ competitive with probability at least 1− ǫ.

It is well known that the connectivity of Gd (n, r) exhibits a threshold property: there exists a constant αd such that for any ϵ> 0, for rd< αd (1− ϵ) log n/n the Gd (n, r) is not connected with high probability1 and for rd> αd (1+ ϵ) log n/n the Gd (n, r) is connected whp. In this paper, we study mixing properties of random walks on Gd (n, r) for rd (n)= ω (log n/n). Specifically, we study the scaling of mixing times of the fastest-mixing reversible random walk, and the natural random walk. We find that the mixing time of both of these random walks have the same scaling laws and scale proportional to r− 2 (for all d). These results hold for Gd (n, r) when distance is defined using any Lp norm. Though the results of this paper are not so surprising, they are nontrivial and require new methods.

We subsequently use this to bound the mixing time of the fastest-mixing random walk on Gd (n, r).

In this paper, we focus on queueing systems that violate admissibility criteria. We show that in a single-server system with multiple queues, the longest queue first (LQF) policy disallows a fair allocation of service rates. We also describe the duality shared by LQF's rate allocation and a fair rate allocation. In general, we demonstrate that the rate allocation performed by the maximum weight matching (MWM) scheduling algorithm in overloaded IQ switches is unfair. We attribute this to the lack of coordination between admission control and scheduling, and propose fair scheduling algorithms that minimize delay for nonoverloaded queues.",21,"Fair scheduling in input-queued switches under inadmissible traffic

The main problem in the IQ switches concerns scheduling. The main focus of the research has been the fixed length packet-known as cells-case. The scheduling decision becomes relatively easier for cells compared to the variable length packet case as scheduling needs to be done at a regular interval of fixed cell time. In real traffic dividing the variable packets into cells at the input side of the switch and then reassembling these cells into packets on the output side achieve it. The disadvantages of this cell-based approach are the following: (a) bandwidth is lost as division of a packet may generate incomplete cells, and (b) additional overhead of segmentation and reassembling cells into packets. This motivates the packet scheduling: scheduling is done in units of arriving packet sizes and in nonpreemptive fashion. In M.A. Marsan et al.

A dual frequency signal is compressed, spectrally enriched and made pedestal free by propagating through an appropriate combination of conventional single mode fiber and/or a non-linear fiber loop mirror consisting of dispersion shifted fiber/conventional single mode fiber. Our numerical studies reveal that one can not ignore chromatic dispersion effects in non-linear loop mirror.

Power levels of beat signal for peak transmittivity (Tp) to be unity have been calculated with an amplifier inside NFLM (NFLM-I) and outside NFLM (NFLM-O). For coupling ratio f<0.35 in the loop mirror, NFLM-O is found to be a more appropriate choice for shaping of the beat signal. We investigate the effect of incorporating saturable gain and fiber losses in computing accurate peak power levels for Tp. Neglecting these effects will drastically reduce Tp.

Keeping the list sorted under addition and deletion of rules in the classifier is an expensive operation, and may take ЧДЦЕ memory shift (write) operations in the worst case, where Ц is the number of rules in the classifier (or prefixes in the forwarding table). The most common solutions for this problem improve average case, but waste precious TCAM space, and may still run into the worst case. This paper proposes two algorithms to manage the TCAM such that incremental update times remain small in the worst case.

The PA’s role is to learn user treatment effects and assign personalized treatment over time. The following projects aim to infer if (i) the digital interventions and (ii) the PAs used to assign them are effective at the individual level in sequential experiments. These tasks are challenging due to heterogeneity across users and time, biases due to the PA’s sequential adaptivity, the lack of mechanistic models for treatment effect, and data’s noisiness. For (i), we provide the first guarantee for ITE in sequential experiments using a non-parametric mixed-effect/latent factor model for the potential outcomes and nearest neighbor (NN) estimators.

Despite the good performance of such algorithms, there is usually a lack of theoretical guarantee on their performance. A recently proposed approach to time series imputation uses matrix estimation methods to recover missing values after transforming the time series into a matrix. This approach has exhibited superior performance and provides strong theoretical guarantees of performance for a large class of time series with random missing entries with a certain probability. In this study, we tackle the particular case of missing entries in a time series that form long blocks of consecutive values of different lengths, and we identify the effect of such scenarios, involving missing values, on the accuracy of matrix estimation algorithms for time series imputation. As the main contribution of this work, we propose an extension to the matrix estimation approach to time series imputation by introducing an adaptive algorithm for selecting the shape of the matrix based on the length of consecutive missing values in the time series. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified by testing it on synthetic datasets consisting of a mixture of autoregressive process, finite sum of harmonics, and a linear trend, as well as real world datasets. Our empirical study shows that the proposed adaptive approach enhances the accuracy of imputation compared with the choice of a fixed matrix shape in 89% of the experiments.

On multivariate singular spectrum analysis,"Devavrat Shah, Paolo Giaccone, Balaji Prabhakar",,,,,,"Randomized algorithms have proved particularly effective in providing good scalable solutions to problems where decisions need to be made within a limited amount of time and/or with little information. The main idea of randomized algorithms is simply stated: Basing decisions on a few randomly chosen samples is often a good surrogate for basing decisions with complete knowledge of the state. This paper is about the design of randomized algorithms for switdi scheduling. We begin by examining the difficulty of implementing wellknown deterministic solutions like the minimum weight matching algorithm, discuss a simple randomized proposed by Tassiulas [1], develop a suite of novel randomized algorithms, and discuss their theory and perfor-mance.",0,"An Efﬁcient Randomized Algorithm for Input-Queued Switch Scheduling

Two Burning Questions on COVID-19: Did shutting down the economy help? Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?,"Ravichandra Addanki, Mohammad Alizadeh, Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan, Devavrat Shah, Qiaomin Xie, Zhi Xu",,,,,,"AlphaGo Zero (AGZ) introduced a new {\em tabula rasa} reinforcement learning algorithm that has achieved superhuman performance in the games of Go, Chess, and Shogi with no prior knowledge other than the rules of the game. This success naturally begs the question whether it is possible to develop similar high-performance reinforcement learning algorithms for generic sequential decision-making problems (beyond two-player games), using only the constraints of the environment as the ``rules.'' To address this challenge, we start by taking steps towards developing a formal understanding of AGZ. AGZ includes two key innovations: (1) it learns a policy (represented as a neural network) using {\em supervised learning} with cross-entropy loss from samples generated via Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS); (2) it uses {\em self-play} to learn without training data. We argue that the self-play in AGZ corresponds to learning a Nash equilibrium for the two-player game; and the supervised learning with MCTS is attempting to learn the policy corresponding to the Nash equilibrium, by establishing a novel bound on the difference between the expected return achieved by two policies in terms of the expected KL divergence (cross-entropy) of their induced distributions. To extend AGZ to generic sequential decision-making problems, we introduce a {\em robust MDP} framework, in which the agent and nature effectively play a zero-sum game: the agent aims to take actions to maximize reward while nature seeks state transitions, subject to the constraints of that environment, that minimize the agent's reward.

On reinforcement learning for turn-based zero-sum Markov games,Devavrat Shah,,,,,,"The classical alternating minimization (or projection) algorithm has been successful in the context of solving optimization problems over two variables or equivalently of finding a point in the intersection of two sets. The iterative nature and simplicity of the algorithm has led to its application to many areas such as signalprocessing, information theory, control, and finance.
A general set of sufficient conditions for the convergence and correctness of the algorithm is quite well-known when the underlying problem parametersare fixed. In many practical situations, however, the underlying problem parametersare changing over time, and theuse of an adaptive algorithm ismore appropriate. In this paper, we study such an adaptive version of the alternating minimization algorithm.

Estimation of skill distribution from a tournament,"Vivek Farias, Srikanth Jagabathula, Devavrat Shah",,,,,,"The central operational problem faced by managers is the prediction of revenues from various offer sets using the available historical sales data. Such revenue predictions form crucial inputs to assortment planning: deciding the “optimal” offer set with respect to a given objective (eg revenue) subject to various constraints (eg limited display or shelf space). Clearly, the offer set significantly impacts the choices made by the customers and, hence, the revenues and the margins seen by the seller. Therefore, it is the key decision problem, for instance, faced by retailers and has several variants depending on the desired objective and the imposed constraints. In all these variants, the key building block towards making such decisions is the procedure that estimates the revenue for a given offer set based on the historical sales data. Estimation of the revenues of a given offer set primarily requires two components:(1) prices of the products in the offer set and (2) the chance that a given product in the offer set is purchased by an incoming customer when the offer set is on display. Given prices of products, the revenue estimation boils down to predicting the share (fraction of sales) of each product in the offer set. This is challenging because of substitution behavior, where customers substitute an unavailable product with an available one. This makes the share observed for a product a combination of the primary demand for the product and the additional demand observed due to substitution. Clearly, capturing these substitution effects effectively is crucial to producing accurate revenue estimates.

Applications and instances of CPS are present in many diverse technological areas, including among others energy, transportation, telecommunications, environmental monitoring, biomedical and biological systems. Current CPS design suffers from many issues such as scalability, robustness, and performance satisfaction.
In such systems, direct information about the physical world is usually acquired through a number of local entities, which can be geographically extended (eg, nervous system, sensor networks), and are often of a heterogeneous nature (eg, temperature, audio, chemical). The operation and performance requirements are global in nature, and are often represented and expressed in terms of aggregate properties of the overall system (eg, degree of maneuverability of an airplane, survival, prediction of power outage). The management of such systems entails the integration between a physical layer, which includes the underlying physical system as well as the fixed architectural constraints, and a virtual layer which addresses the design of the information layer and the supporting decision protocols which is designed to achieve a global set of objectives. The information layer is designed to be flexible, reconfigurable, and modular in order to deal with dynamic uncertainty, complexity, and resource limitations in communication and computation, and as a result, its design is intertwined with the decision systems.

Improvement in Satellite Images by Amalgam of Brovey and PCA Algorithm with Artificial Neural Network,"Vivek Farias, Srikanth Jagabathula, Devavrat Shah",,,,,,"A central push in operations models over the last decade has been the incorporation of models of customer choice. Real world implementations of many of these models face the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the ‘right’model of choice to use. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a ‘generic’model of consumer choice (namely, distributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal preference information), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? We present a framework to answer such questions and design a number of tractable algorithms from a data and computational standpoint for the same. This paper thus takes the very first step towards ‘automating’the crucial task of selecting an appropriate choice model.",0,"A New Approach to Modeling Choice

Learning RUMs: Reducing Mixture to Single Component via PCA,"Gagan Aggarwal, Rajeev Motwani, Devavrat Shah, An Zhu",,,,,,"The essence of an Internet router is an n ข n switch which routes packets from input to output ports. Such a switch can be viewed as a bipartite graph with the input and output ports as the two vertex sets. Packets arriving at input port i and destined for output port j can be modeled as an edge from i to j. Current switch scheduling algorithms view the routing of packets at each time step as a selection of a bipartite matching. We take the view that the switch scheduling problem across a sequence of time-steps is an instance of the edge coloring problem for a bipartite multigraph. Implementation considerations lead us to seek edge coloring algorithms for bipartite multigraphs that are fast, decentralized, and online. We present a randomized algorithm which has the desired properties, and uses only a near-optimal∆ ท o ด∆ ต colors on dense bipartite graphs arising in the context of switch scheduling.

It leads to a novel switch scheduling algorithm which, for stochastic online edge arrivals, is stable, ie, the queue length at each input port is bounded at all times. We note that this is the first decentralized switch scheduling algorithm that is also guaranteed to be stable.",0,"Switch Scheduling via Randomized Edge Coloring ฃ
