SwitchNet: Learning to switch for word-level language identification in code-mixed social media text,"Neelakshi Sarma, Ranbir Sanasam Singh, Diganta Goswami",2022/5,Natural Language Engineering,28,3,Cambridge University Press,"Word-level language identification is an essential prerequisite for extracting useful information from code-mixed social media content. Previous studies in word-level language identification show two important observations. First, the local context is an important indicator of the language of a word when a word is valid in multiple languages. Second, considering the word in isolation from its context leads to more effective language classification when a word is borrowed or embedded into sentences of other languages. In this paper, we propose a framework for language identification that makes use of a dynamic switching mechanism for effective language classification of both words that are borrowed or embedded from other languages as well as words that are valid in multiple languages. For a given input, the proposed switching mechanism makes a dynamic decision to bias its prediction either towards the …",3,"SwitchNet: Learning to switch for word-level language identification in code-mixed social media text

A Hybrid Machine Transliteration Model Based on Multi-source Encoder–Decoder Framework: English to Manipuri,"Lenin Laitonjam, Sanasam Ranbir Singh",2022/3,SN Computer Science,3,,Springer Singapore,"In this paper, we propose a neural hybrid machine transliteration model that captures the characteristics of both grapheme and phoneme representations. Unlike previous hybrid models that rely on linear interpolation or statistical correspondence of grapheme and phoneme sequences, the proposed model is based on the popular neural encoder–decoder-based transliteration model. We strengthen the traditional encoder–decoder transliteration models to multi-source framework to take advantage of both grapheme and phoneme sequences. This study investigates the responses of various encoder–decoder neural models integrated with the proposed hybrid model.

Synonymy Expansion Using Link Prediction Methods: A Case Study of Assamese WordNet,"Bornali Phukon, Akash Anil, Sanasam Ranbir Singh, Priyankoo Sarmah",2021/11/2,Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing,21,1,ACM,"WordNets built for low-resource languages, such as Assamese, often use the expansion methodology. This may result in missing lexical entries and missing synonymy relations. As the Assamese WordNet is also built using the expansion method, using the Hindi WordNet, it also has missing synonymy relations. As WordNets can be visualized as a network of unique words connected by synonymy relations, link prediction in complex network analysis is an effective way of predicting missing relations in a network. Hence, to predict the missing synonyms in the Assamese WordNet, link prediction methods were used in the current work that proved effective.

Further, we propose a centrality aware random-walk for node embedding and tweet representations suitable for the multi-layer network. From various experimental analysis, it is evident that the proposed method can address the problem of under-specificity, noisy text, and multilingual content present in a tweet and provides better classification performance than the text-based counterparts.

An advantage of considering syllabic features is its ability to achieve reasonable detection accuracy even with a much smaller dataset. In this paper, we propose various syllabic features by exploiting syllable-to-syllable relationships and investigate its effect on word polarity detection over a limited word corpus for Manipuri language (a resource-poor language spoken in Manipur, a state in North …",0,"Word polarity detection using syllable features for manipuri language

Automatic pause marking for speech synthesis,"Loitongbam Gyanendro Singh, Nagaraj Adiga, Bidisha Sharma, Sanasam Ranbir Singh, SRM Prasanna",2017/11/5,,,,IEEE,"Accurate detection of pause boundary plays a major role in the segmentation of the speech corpus and improving the quality of speech synthesis. For pause modelling, we need to have pause tags in the training sentences. Manual tagging of pause is accurate but have the possibilities of missing out due to human error, and it is time-consuming. In this work, an automatic approach for marking the pause in the training corpus is proposed. During the training phase, after every word explicit pause (PAU) tags are added to represent a pause. Then, models for all phones including PAU are trained and re-alignment is performed. During re-alignment, each PAU boundary is corrected using three speech specific features namely, modulation spectrum energy, spectral peaks energy, and strength of excitation. The proposed approach gives a better result as compared to manual pause marking with less time complexity. It also …",1,"Automatic pause marking for speech synthesis

This paper proposes several data-driven methods for automatic syllabification of words written in Manipuri language. Manipuri is one of the scheduled Indian languages. First, we propose a language-independent rule-based approach formulated using entropy based phonotactic segmentation. Second, we project the syllabification problem as a sequence labeling problem and investigate its effect using various sequence labeling approaches. Third, we combine the effect of sequence labeling and rule-based method and investigate the performance of the hybrid approach. From various experimental observations, it is evident that the proposed methods outperform the baseline rule-based method.

However, as network evolves, existing relationships degrade and break down, and some nodes go to hibernation or decide not to participate in any kind of activities in the network where it belongs. Such nodes and links, which we refer as ""dull"", may affect analysis and prediction tasks in networks. This paper formally defines the problem of predicting dull nodes and links at an early stage, and proposes a novel time aware method to solve it. Pruning of such nodes and links is framed as ""network data cleaning"" task. As the definitions of dull node and link are non-trivial and subjective, a novel scheme to label such nodes and links is also proposed here.

It can quickly progress to metastasis causing higher mortality among HNSCC patients. Hence, finding effective and alternative approaches to control the growth and progression of head and neck cancer are desirable for the management of HNSCC. Herein, we have studied the effect of andrographolide, the main constituent of a medicinal herb Andrographis paniculata, against growth and progression of head and neck cancer cells. Growth and viability of the HNSCC cancer cells were found to be significantly (P< 0.001) decreased with AG treatment in dose-dependent manner at 48 h of treatment in Cal 33 and UM-SCC-22B HNSCC cells. AG treatment on HNSCC cells at 5 to 25 μM concentrations for 24 and 48 h caused (P< 0.001) G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. G2/M phase cell cycle arrest sustained at 48 h in UM-SCC-22B cells while it was not observed for Cal 33 cells at this time point. This arrest was followed by an increase in sub-G1 phase cell population which is an indicator of apoptotic cell death. At molecular level, AG treatment downregulated (up to 80%) the protein levels of Cyclin B1 and CDK1 and enhanced (up to 3.7 fold) the expression of CDKI namely Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27. It also increased apoptosis which was accompanied with PARP cleavage in cancer cells. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of antiproliferative properties involving cell cycle arrest for AG against HNSCC cells.",1,"Andrographolide Induces G2/M Phase Cell Cycle Arrest in Human Head and Neck Cancer Cells

Absence of CD 9 expression in acute myeloid leukemia: possible correlation with t (8; 21),"SK Gupta, A Chopra, S Singh, R Kumar, S Bakhshi, L Kumar, A Sharma",2015/6,International Journal of Laboratory Hematology,37,3,,"Sir, Recognition of novel immunophenotypic associations with the genetically and prognostically distinct subgroups of acute leukemia is desirable as they can provide valuable addition to the diagnostic algorithms and also help in minimal residual disease monitoring. CD9 is a tetraspanin molecule that regulates integrin-mediated functions such as adhesion and motility [1]. It has been shown earlier that low expression or absence of CD9 on leukemic cells fairly accurately predicts t (12; 21)(ETV6-RUNX1) in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)[2]. Similar to ALL with t (12; 21), RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (previously AML1-ETO) fusion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t (8; 21) results in repression of normal RUNX1 gene [3]. A possibility of RUNX1 having a regulatory role in CD9 expression has been raised earlier [4].

Functional outcomes of sensorimotor balance training as compared to dorsiflexor strengthening in elderly population,"S Singh, N Multani",2015/5/1,Physiotherapy,101,,Elsevier,"Background: Balancing difficulties and susceptibility to fall is an increasing problem with ageing that could compromise health and quality of the elderly. Investigators documenting improvement in balance or reduction of falls among the ageing population have used two approaches, one of them is to enhance balance and other one is to strengthen the muscles particularly of the lower limb. Current evidence suggests that both of these approaches reduce the risk of falls but the efficacy of these training programs from the view point of functional independence is still unclear. As a consequence, the present study was planned to evaluate functional outcomes of sensorimotor balance training as compared to ankle dorsiflexor muscle strengthening.
Purpose: Analyse and compare the role of sensorimotor balance training and dorsiflexor strength training in improving the functional status of the ageing population.

Detailed history, meticulous physical examination, relevant laboratory investigations along with good preoperative pharmacological optimization and fluid resuscitation plays an important role in the perioperative period. Genetic testing and counseling should be offered to all the family members of patients suspected of familial predisposition. We report the anesthetic management of 10 year old male child with bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma with family history of disease.
Clinical Features: A10-year old male, presented to our pediatric outpatient clinic with gradually increasing holocranial headache, blurring of vision, sweating, photophobia, progressive quietness in nature and poor performance in school, increased thirst and urine output for one week along with pain over bilateral lower limbs and difficulty walking without support for 20days. Parents also reported two episodes of generalized convulsions with one episode of opisthotonic posturing and up rolling of eyes, which was sustained for 50 min.

Two-phase flow instability and bifurcation analysis of inclined multiple uniformly heated channels-15107,"AM Mishra, S Paul, S Singh, V Panday",2015,,,,,"[en] In this paper the two-phase flow instability analysis of multiple heated channels with various inclinations is studied. In addition, the bifurcation analysis is also carried out to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the system and to identify the regions in parameter space for which subcritical and supercritical bifurcations exist. In order to carry out the analysis, the system is mathematically represented by nonlinear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for mass, momentum and energy in single as well as two-phase region. Then converted into Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) using weighted residual method. Also, coupling equation is being used under the assumption that pressure drop in each channel is the same and the total mass flow rate is equal to sum of the individual mass flow rates. The homogeneous equilibrium model is used for the analysis. Stability Map is obtained in terms of phase change number (Npch) and Subcooling Number (Nsb) by solving a set of nonlinear, coupled algebraic equations obtained at equilibrium using Newton Raphson Method. MATLAB Code is verified by comparing it with results obtained by Matcont (Open source software) under same parametric values. Numerical simulations of the time-dependent, nonlinear ODEs are carried out for selected points in the operating parameter space to obtain the actual damped and growing oscillations in the channel inlet flow velocity which confirms the stability region across the stability map. Generalized Hopf (GH) points are observed for different inclinations, they are also points for subcritical and supercritical bifurcations.(authors)",0,"Two-phase flow instability and bifurcation analysis of inclined multiple uniformly heated channels-15107

Observations: A prong of a strong/stout crocodile action forceps fractured during attempts to firmly hold a metallic foreign body prior to its extraction. It slipped in the digestive tract as the airway was secured with cuffed endotracheal tube and subsequently was excreted per via naturalis.
Conclusions and relevance: The contributing factors for failure of metallic instrument can be related to its (1) moderate to severe degree of Impaction and (2) quality of metal used in the instrument: Routine inspection of microsurgical instruments for early detection of metal corrosion and fatigue is desirable while strength of forceps may be tested by its firm grasp/indention on a paraffin wax.

Potential role of host tree species in determining the composition of polysaccharides of Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) Karst.(GLPS),"S Singh, NSK Harsh, PK Gupta",2015,Current Research in Environmental & Applied Mycology,5,3,,"Ganoderma lucidum is a basidiomycetous white rot fungus which has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries particularly in countries such as China, Japan and Korea. Several classes of bioactive substances have been isolated and identified from basidiocarp, mycelia and spores of G. lucidum, such as polysaccharides, triterpenoids, nucleosides, sterols, fatty acids, protein and alkaloids. One of the major pharmacological properties of G. lucidum is antitumor activity and polysaccharides (GLPS) are the main component responsible for this property. In this paper, the possible role of host tree species in determining the composition of polysaccharides (GLPS) was examined. To date, a careful comparison of polysaccharides (GLPS) from different host tree species has not been performed. Fruiting bodies were collected from nine host tree species from different regions of India and examined for their polysaccharide composition. These fruit bodies were analyzed and compared on the basis of Gas liquid chromatography (GLC). The result showed the fruit body from Dalbergia sissoo was most potential for GLPS production, as it was composed of all six tested monosaccharides, including rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, fructose, glucose and mannose. It also showed the presence of intense host-dependent variability among isolates.",3,"Potential role of host tree species in determining the composition of polysaccharides of Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.)

"Human resource management in India: strategy, performance and complementarity","S Singh, T Darwish, G Wood",2015,,,,Academy of International Business,"This study seeks to explore which types of HR practice are associated with better organisational performance (OP). Whilst the core finding—that specific HR practices lead to better organisational outcomes may not be surprising—we also found an absence of complementarity. Normally, the absence of complementarities would suggest limitations in institutional supports; on the one hand, however, institutional shortfalls are not unique to India and may be encountered in many emerging market settings. In contrast, the great internal diversity of the Indian setting, with strong variations recognised amongst institutions, along with enforcement capabilities, might suggest that these tendencies are particularly pronounced. We also found a strong link between the intrinsic rewards and performance—an unexpected result in a low-income country, where wages are generally low. We suggest that this may reflect the nature of the labour market and the limited (and possibly proportionately shrinking) pool of good jobs, making exit a difficult option for all but the best qualified. Whilst this puts employees in a poor bargaining position in bidding-up pay (making pay rises seem unfeasible), the intrinsic attributes of the job become more important.",0,"Human resource management in India: strategy, performance and complementarity

CFD Analysis and Enhancement Of Heat Transfer In Rectangular Channel Using Blockage with Elongated Hole,"S Kandwal, Rajeev Pandey, Dr S Singh",2015,International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology,6,7,,"A model of channel with blockage designed and meshed in ALTAIR® HYPERMESH V. 11 and used ALTAIR® ACUSOLVE for CFD analysis. The CFD analysis is validated by the experimental data. The rectangular channel has a width-to-height ratio of 11: 1. The blockages are subdivided into two different cases using two different aspect ratios (hole-width-to-height ratio) which are determined by the number of holes with four and six holes per blockage. According to the results it is observed that at all Reynolds numbers, the h and Nu increases with increase in pitch ratio up to the value of 6.0 and then decreases with further increase in pitch ratio. This variation in h and Nu is due to flow reattachment downstream of the blockage’s opening and then redevelopment of boundary layer up to the succeeding next blockage’s opening. The blockages with shorter holes enhance heat transfer better than those with longer holes but they also yield significantly higher pressure drops than blockages with longer holes.",3,"CFD Analysis and Enhancement Of Heat Transfer In Rectangular Channel Using Blockage with Elongated Hole

Appl. Biosci,40,2,,"Histomorphological changes in neurosecretory cells of eyestalk, brain and thoracic ganglia of Penaeus monodon during different stages of ovarian maturation were recorded. There were five types of neurosecretory cells (NSCs) in eyestalk with size ranging from 5 to 35 µm. They were distributed along medulla externa, medulla interna and medulla terminalis. Axonal terminals of these neurosecretory cells were found to terminate in sinus gland. Brain and thoracic ganglia possessed five types of neurosecretory cells such as giant neuron (> 80 µm), A (61-80 µm), B (41-60 µm), C (21-40 µm) and D (< 20 µm). They were arranged in several groups in different parts of brain-in anterior region B, C and D cells were observed, in posterior region giant neurons and A cells were more in number while A, B, C and D cells were found in lateral regions. In thoracic ganglia NSCs were distributed in anterior and posterior portions but were lacking in middle region. A and B cells were noticed in anterior region followed by C and D cells. In posterior region, giant neurons and A cells were seen. Ovarian maturation in P. monodon seems to be under dual control of inhibitory action by the secretion of B and C cells of eyestalk and stimulatory influence by giant neuron (GN), A and B cells of brain and thoracic ganglia because the NSCs of eyestalk were active in immature stage whereas cells of brain and thoracic ganglia were active in mature females.

It plays an important role for imparting knowledge and updating skills of the farmers. To make training meaningful and effective, it is very much important to identify the training needs of the farmers based on which a suitable training module can be designed. It is essential to organize an appropriate training to the right people, in the right form, at the right time. Mushrooms are macro fungi with distinctive fruiting bodies large enough to be seen by naked eyes and have significant nutritive value. They are rich in fiber and have high Vitamin B 12 and folic acid content. They are ideal food for patients suffering from hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Favorable climatic condition and availability of paddy straw offers tremendous scope for cultivation of oyster mushroom in West Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh. However, the farmers are ignorant about the commercial cultivation of mushroom. Keeping the above in view, the present study was undertaken to identify the main areas of training in relation to scientific way of mushroom cultivation. The study was undertaken to know the relationship of selected personnel, socio-economic and psychological characteristics of the respondents with their training needs in relation to commercial mushroom cultivation.",1,"Training needs of scientific mushroom cultivation in Arunachal Pradesh.

Generating Manipuri English pronunciation dictionary using sequence labelling problem,"Ramkishore Singh, Ian Joseph Lazarus, SP Singh",2014,Energy and environment research,,,The Canadian Center of Science and Education,"Cold storage is a key element for long term preservation and distribution of perishable items. A large quantity of perishable items is gone wastage every year due to inadequate storage facility in the countries like India. Their energy extensive refrigeration process makes them accountable for substantial share of total energy consumption in the country. Moreover, energy inefficiency in operation and building designs in the existing cold storages inhibits expansion of desirable storage facility. This study aims to explore the building and refrigeration system’s parameters that may influence the overall energy consumption in the storage. A survey was conducted in ten Indian potato cold storages and detail data of their energy consumption, building construction and refrigeration systems was collected. The collected data was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Trend analysis technique was also used to establish relationship between specific energy consumption and identified parameters. Results show that the utilization factor has major impact on the energy consumption in the storages and the existing cold storages are not utilizing their storage capacities fully. Comparatively higher energy consumption was observed in the cold storages that have low utilization factors. Building aspect ratios and effective U-value of the building envelop were also identified one of the crucial parameters that can play a major role to improve the energy performance of the cold storages. As expected, a negligible variation in the specific energy consumption of the storages with the specific installed refrigeration systems and AHUs was observed.",2,"Impact of building and refrigeration system’s parameters on energy consumption in the potato cold storage

Epidural injection, besides surgical decompression, is now one of the most common modality of treatment in lumbar disc herniation who doesn’t responds to conservative therapy. The main aim of our study was to evaluate the role of fluoroscopically guided caudal epidural injection with or without steroids in patients of one or two level lumbar disc herniation.
Material and methods:
Two groups were made group N and group S. Each patient in group S received 2 ml (80 mg) of methyl prednisolone mixed with 10 ml of lignocaine (2%) and diluted in 18 ml of normal saline and group N received 10 ml of lignocaine (2%) with 20 ml of normal saline. A total of 3 caudal epidural injections were given to each patient at an interval of 3 weeks. All patients were prospectively assessed with examination of straight leg raising, visual analogue scale pain scores and Oswestry Disability Scale at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 month interval.
Results:
No statistically significant differences were observed in the baseline scores between the 2 groups. At follow up, Pain scores, ODI and SLR changed significantly from baseline in both groups, with no significant differences between the two groups except at the 1 month where decrease in VAS and ODI Score was significantly more in group S. No patient reported any major immediate or late complication (s) following caudal epidural injection.

Presently, H-reflex is considered as reliable tool to objectively measure motoneuronal excitability hence muscle tone. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of 6 minutes of effleurage massage and 6 minutes of kneading massage on muscle tone as measured by changes in amplitude of H-reflex recordings. Seventeen healthy volunteers (8 male, 9 female,= 26.53±5.67 years of age) participated in the study. H-reflexes were recorded immediately before and after application of massage technique, peak to peak amplitude of ten H-reflexes was selected for analysis. The Student’s t-test was used for comparison of pre and post-massage values of H-reflex amplitude and also for comparison between mean difference values for H-reflex amplitude of both massage interventions. Significant decrease in H-amplitude was observed after 6 min of effleurage massage (t= 3.57, p≤ 0.05), reduction in H-amplitude albeit non-significant was also observed after 6 min of kneading massage (t= 0.69, p≤ 0.05). Further comparison of mean difference values of H-amplitude for both massage techniques showed non-significant differences (t-1.99, p≤ 0.05) hence neither of massage technique proved to be effective over other in decreasing reflex activity of muscle.",1,"Comparison of Effect of Six Minutes of Effleurage and Kneading Massage on

First, the assumption that eigenvectors are constant over time is not valid for lower order eigenvectors and eigenvectors evolve over time as network evolves. A regression based method is proposed to predict evolving eigenvectors. Second, the spectral condition that higher order eigenvalues are greater than or equal to lower order eigenvalues may not be guaranteed by traditional curve fitting. Two smoothing methods are proposed to address this issue.

Functional outcomes of sensorimotor balance training as compared to dorsiflexor strengthening in elderly population,"Prithpal S Matreja, PS Matreja, A Singh, PML Khanna, S Singh",2013/6,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is an inflammatory disease with worldwide prevalence of 10-40%. Clinically, the condition manifests as nasal itching (pruritus), sneezing, rhinorrhea, congestion and itchy eyes. The second generation antihistamines are commonly used either as nasal sprays (azelastine) or orally (levocetirizine). Studies have demonstrated equal efficacy of azelastine and levocetirizine, but the data on Indian population is lacking. Hence, we designed this study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of azelastine in comparison to levocetirizine in patients with allergic rhinitis.
METHODS: This prospective, randomized, parallel group study was conducted in the otorhinolaryngology outpatient department. Both male and female patients between the ages of 18 to 55 years were enrolled in the study after informed consent. Patients were randomized into two groups. Subjects in group 1 received azelastine whereas group 2 received levocetirizine. Clinic visits were scheduled at baseline and after every 2 weeks of treatment for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was mean change in the total daytime nasal symptom scores (PDTS) and secondary outcomes were mean change in the nighttime nasal symptom scores (PNTS) and composite symptom scores (PCS).
RESULTS: We enrolled 40 patients, 20 in each group. Both groups were comparable at baseline and tolerated treatment well. There was significant (p< 0.05) improvement in mean PDTS, PNTS and PCS scores in both groups from second week onwards. There was significant (p< 0.05) improvement in patients in group 1 at 4 weeks in the mean PDTS and PCS score. There …",0,"Efficacy and Safety of Azelastine and Levocetirizine in Allergic Rhinitis

There are various drugs and techniques used to achieve this target, even though these are illegal and punishable. Women desirous of male child try to procure these drugs which are supposed to help in sex selection. These secretly procured drugs can cause congenital defects in the fetus due to the fact that these drugs are always administered during first trimester-the most vulnerable period for the fetus. There are many drugs, whose teratogenic potential is already known. But in the absence of enough data and lack of clinical trial studies in pregnant women, we don’t really know about many drugs, which are necessary for various medical conditions during pregnancy. On top of that these so called sex selection drugs add to an unhealthy practice leading to many more probable congenital anomalies. It is the need of the hour that proper data is collected about all such drugs and their implications is studied on fetus. Due to secret prescriptions, it may be difficult to ban such drugs, but public awareness and health education about congenital anomalies caused by such drugs is probably the only way to fight this menace.",0,"Undetermined Teratogenic Risks by Traditional Sex Selection Drugs.

Especially, for neutron waveguides such multilayer super mirror coatings have become an essential need for efficient neutron guides to the experimental stations. When thermal or cold neutrons reflect from a surface of a medium at grazing incidence, the refractive index of the medium is dictated by scattering length density (SLD) of the medium. Due to large contrast of SLD for neutrons, Ni (+ ve SLD) and Ti (-ve SLD) pairs are usually preferred as multilayer coatings for neutron supermirrors. Ni/Ti multilayer having fixed bi-layer thickness acts as a narrowband mirror, which exhibits high value of neutron reflectivity at a Bragg peak for a very limited neutron wavelength regime while, supermirrors consisting of graded multilayer thickness exhibit high reflectance over a considerable zone of angles. In the present reporting, Ni/Ti based neutron mirrors and supermirrors have been deposited on crystalline silicon (111) substrate in an indigenously developed RF magnetron sputtering system. The designs have been carried out using Hayter and Mook's recursive formalism. Initially, single layer films have been deposited and characterized by X-ray reflectometry (XRR) to optimize the sputtering conditions such that good neutron optical index and low surface and interface roughness are achieved.

All these problems together lead to increasing challenges for sustainability of dryland crop production. These problems can be reversed, stopped, or at least reduced if the farming community can be motivated to adopt appropriate technologies developed by the National Agricultural Research System (NARS). This is possible only if an economy driven enterprise is the template of the farming system in vogue in these areas. This means that a farmer should receive higher and staggered income from the holding. The redefined agro-horti system is unique as it focuses on assisting farmers in creating a situation where they are managing their own natural resources including livestock in a sustainable productive way, and making them less dependent on outside labour and forest areas. In order to meet the challenges and the vagaries of monsoon, to evolve suitable technology to minimize such risk and to achieve stability in the dryland areas and consistent with the policy of conservation and desirability of preserving the integrity of the ecosystem, the alternate land use systems in the form of agro-horti system could be suggested.

Running time of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is O (ve2). The asymptotically fastest maximumflow algorithms are based on push-relabel method and have the running time of O (V3). M. Stoer and F.

Generally it is modelled statistically.Practically it is not possible to estimate perfectly the information over wireless channel at the receiver. By investigating the probability density function of the different fading channel we can derive analytical expressions for probability of error (SER/BER). These expressions are used to compute performance degradation due to channel's fading behaviour. However, there is no generalized expression for any performance measure. So, in this research paper we have presented up to date performance analysis based on BER considering different modulation techniques.

Growth and developmental behaviour of Lipaphis erysimi (Kalt.) at leaf and flowering stages on different mustard genotypes.,"S Singh, P Datta",2013,Indian Journal of Fundamental and Applied Life Sciences,3,4,Centre for Info Bio Technology (CIBTech),"Rice deserves a special status among cereals as world's most important wetland crop. The inoculation of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria is an alternative and sustainable source of nitrogen to increase the rice productivity. Contribution of diazotrophic cyanobacteria to the nitrogen fertility of paddy fields and there by to the productivity and yields of rice crop result from mineralization of their biomass and not from immediate availability of fixed molecular nitrogen. The success of the wet land rice agriculture is heavily dependent on the extensive use of herbicides for selective elimination of weeds of rice-crops. Herbicides are not only detrimental to weeds but to biofertilizer strains of cyanobacteria also. The strains of free living cyanobacteria defective in ammonia assimilation leading to extracellular liberation of N 2-derived ammonia, and tolerating common rice field herbicides would be ideal for use as biofertilizer in rice field. In this study the effect of ammonia excretory multiple herbicide resistant mutant strain of diazotrophic cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis [Av (MHR-Eda) r] as biofertilizer on growth and yield attributes of rice crop (IR-36) were evaluated. The ammonia excretory multiple herbicide resistant mutant strain treated rice plant exhibited 26% increase in seed germination, 45% increase in seedling growth and 83% increase in grain yield as compared to untreated control. The maximum range of growth and yields parameters were recorded more in this mutant strain when compared to other treatments. The results suggest that the application of this improved cyanobacterial biofertilizer strain significantly enhances growth and productivity of …",0,"Evaluation of biofertilizer potentiality of ammonia excretory multiple herbicide resistant strain of Anabaena variabilis on growth and productivity of rice.

In particular the development of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as applied to polymers, has allowed a wealth of information regarding the surface elemental and functional-group composition to be obtained. Many interesting correlations between the surface composition, as determined by XPS, and interfacial phenomena have been noted. These observations have led to the realisation that the structure and properties of the outermost 5 nm or so of a polymer can control the performance of the material in many applications. As with many characterisation techniques, there are limitations on the information obtained by XPS. This has, in part, provided the impetus for developing other techniques which would complement XPS, in terms of both compositional data and surface sensitivity. Static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS) has emerged in the last ten years as one of the most powerful techniques complementary to XPS. As implied by the name of the technique, a mass spectrum representative of the surface is obtained. This chapter will give brief outlines of the two techniques and some of their applications. Before commencing on the main points of this chapter, it is worth emphasising that both of these techniques require high-vacuum conditions in order to operate.

Some evidence has linked probiotic use to clinical infection, especially in immunocompromised hosts; however, molecular data confirming a probiotic as the definitive source of an infection in an immunocompetent host is sparse.
We report a case of invasive disease due to Lactobacillus in a 51 year old male with a history of colon cancer in remission. He developed post-operative sepsis and endocarditis following surgical repair of a colovesicular fistula. Several Lactobacillus species were cultivated from the patient’s blood and a surgically removed mitral valve. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the patient was consuming several probiotic supplements.
Methods: Probiotic supplements used by the patient were obtained and cultured. All patient and probiotic isolates were identified by phenotypic methods and bidirectional 16S rRNA sequencing. Repetitive element PCR (rep-PCR; Diversilab, BioMerieux) was performed on all isolates from the probiotic supplements and the patient’s blood and valve cultures.
Results: Recovered probiotic isolates (n= 14) included various Lactobacillus species (rhamnosus [n= 3], delbrueckii [n= 2], kefiri [n= 1], plantarum [n= 1], salivarius [n= 1]), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris (n= 1), and Streptococcus thermophilus (n= 5).

Our data indicate that the films exhibit coexistence of different magnetic phases as a function of depth. The variation of magnetism with depth is correlated with a variation of chemical composition with depth. Using PNR we also measured the magnetization depth profile of the LPCMO film as a function of applied bending stress. From these measurements we were able to obtain values for the coupling coefficients relating strain to the variation of the magnetization depth profile. Our results suggest that application of compressive (tensile) bending stress increases (suppresses) magnetization. We will discuss the implications of our results on the prevailing theories of the role of strain on phase separation in manganites.,0,"Magnetic non-uniformity in (La 0.4 Pr 0.6) 0.67 Ca 0.33 MnO 3 films and measurement of the strain-magnetization coupling coefficient

Apoptosis is strictly regulated through many molecular mechanisms, including the proteolytic enzymes such as cathepsin D. Cathepsin D, a lysosomal aspartyl endopeptidase, regulates intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Presence of cathepsin D in the cytosol activates caspase-8 which induces the apoptotic pathway. Cathepsin D also stimulates the apoptosis by DNA damaging agents and through p53 dependent non-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Cathepsin D being a lysosomal enzyme has to be released into cytosol by changing the lysosomal membrane potential or by the over expression of cathepsin d gene. Concanamycin A and Bafilomycin A1, specific inhibitor of V-type ATPase might change the lysosome membrane potential releasing cathepsin D in the cytosol and inducing apoptosis. Lysosome membrane can also be ruptured by generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The over expression cathepsin D can be initiated by the hormonal treatment like estradiol and retinoic acid as the gene is regulated by mixed promoter.

In OFDM systems the available spectrum are divided into many orthogonal sub-channels, which are instantaneously used to data transmission. Also, in this technique the inter-symbol interference (ISI) which is induced due to frequency selective channels can be reduced by adding the cyclic prefix (CP)[1]. In OFDM systems, channel estimation is necessary to obtain the channel state information (CSI), reducing the bit error rate and also to achieve a distortion less output data. There are various methods to channel estimation such as: with or without a need to parametric models, blind or pilot based methods, frequency and/or time domain analysis, adaptive or non adaptive techniques. Among these mentioned methods, channel estimation in OFDM systems is often done in frequency domain using pilot symbols or training data [2]. The least square and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) are conventional linear channel estimation techniques which are based on pilot arrangement.",1,"Overview of Compressive Sensing Based Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems under Long Delay Channels

Consequently the advent of inventive concepts with high conventional power and the development of new strategies and technologies led to the evolution of several bicyclic and tricyclic nitrogen based heterocycles. Terrifying goals were achieved in this direction owing to the constant efforts in the search of new reagents and methods for chemically efficient reactions. At present, research in this field is even more actively promoted by the interplay of organic chemistry and various disciplines of science such as biological sciences and material chemistry that are posing a pressing demand for synthetic molecules in meaningful scale with high level of purity. This is the case of heterocyclic compounds whose utility in organic synthesis, although recognized in recent times, is now well established.

Autogenic drainage versus acapella for airway clearance in patients with bronchiectasis: randomised crossover trial,"Shramana Ghosh, Sarv Parteek Singh",2011/8/17,Assembly line–Theory and Practice,,,,"Application of automation to assembly processes is vitally important to meet the requirements of manufacturing and production. Feeders form a critical part of automated assembly lines (Singh et al., 2009). They are used to feed discrete parts to assembly stations or work cells or assembly cells on the production line from bulk supplies. They convert the randomness of parts into a flow in geometrical patterns such that the parts can become an integral contribution to the production process and get delivered at a pre-determined rate. Most of the time these parts are added to other parts to become the finished product at the end of an assembly line (Mitchell Jr., 2010). Feeders are sometimes also used as inspection devices (Boothroyd, 2005). Part feeders can be designed to reject certain kinds of defective parts, which when fed to the machine may result in its breakdown. Assembly process requires the presence of the correct parts, in the suitable amounts, at the appropriate places and at the right times, in the absence of which the entire production line may come to a halt. Ad-hoc setting of system parameters results in either starvation or saturation, where too less or too many parts are delivered to the work cells respectively. This chapter describes a method of studying the behaviour of part feeding devices via a statistical analysis of the given system, carried out to formulate its empirical model. Once the model has been formulated and its validity confirmed, it can be used to suggest values of inputs and operating factors to get the desired output. The regression model can also be used to find the local optimum.",5,"Optimizing feeding systems

New report of a sweet basil leaf blight caused by Cochliobolus lunatus in India,"A Rai, AK Singh, S Singh, LDS Yadav",2011/4,Synfacts,2011,04,© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart˙ New York,"Significance: Reported is the highly diastereoselective organocatalytic multicomponent cascade synthesis of a series of decahydroquinolines. A mechanism is proposed involving reaction of the organocatalyst with cyclohexanone to form an imine, which then undergoes a highly stereoselective Michael-type addition to the nitroalkene. The resulting adduct then reacts with the N-Ts imine in an aza-Henry reaction, the product of which then undergoes cyclization via hemiaminalization to yield the observed products. Although no evidence is given for this mechanism, it is reasonable given the highly stereoselective nature of the reaction.
Comment: Decahydroquinolines are structural components of a number of biologically active compounds and natural products (eg, pumiliotoxin: C SG Davies, G.

We have taken a more realistic demand rate that depends on two factors, one is time, and the other is the stock level. The stock level in itself obviously gets depleted due to the customer's demand. As a result, what we witness here is a circle in which the customer's demand is being influenced by the level of stocks available, while the stock levels are getting depleted due to the customer's demands. This assumption takes the customer's interests as well as the market forces into account. The demand rate is such that as the inventory level increases, it helps to increase the demand for the inventory under consideration. While as the time passes, demand is depends upon the various factors.

India has about 15% world’s livestock population with only 2% of the world’s geographical area. The dry and green fodder requirement in the year 1998 was estimated to be 1000 and 1200 million tonnes, respectively against the estimated availability of 550 and 350 million tonnes, respectively. Overall, the present availability of animal feeds and fodder is estimated to be 40% of the requirement (Anonymous, 1998). The country has about 4% of the cultivated area under forage crops. The forage crops include all plant species consumed by animal, thereby cover large number of grain and legume plants. The cultivated fodder crops include plant species such as sorghum, Egyptian clover (berseem), lucerne, maize, pearl millet, oats, cowpea, clusterbean (guar) mothbean and several other grasses. Among these, cowpea, clusterbean (guar) and mothbean are mainly grown in kharif season, while Egyptian clover (berseem) and lucerne are major rabi crops. Insect-pests are one of the major constraints in increasing and stabilizing the production and productivity of these forage crops. Integrated pest management (IPM) approach has been accepted worldwide for achieving sustainability in agriculture. This type of approach has numerous advantages like pesticides free produce, safety to environment, beneficial for natural enemies and low input based crop production programme especially for forage crops.

The hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of the root of H. barteri were investigated for anti-nociceptive and antiinflammatory properties and probable mechanism of action. Hot plate, tail flick, formalin-induced oedema and acetic acidinduced writhing tests were employed to investigate the anti-nociceptive activity while the anti-inflammatory activity was investigated using carrageenan-induced paw oedema. Anti-histaminic potential of HB root extracts on the rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC s) was explored through spectrofluorometric method. The root was screened for its phytochemical components. The HB root contains alkaloids, cardenolides and saponins. HXHBR exhibited higher anti-inflammatory potentials (P< 0.001). HXHBR dose-dependently (P< 0.01) reduced the histamine release from the rat peritoneal mast cells which is comparable with a standard anti-histaminic drug, ketotifen. These results showed that EAHBR and HXHBR possess anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities, and suggested its mechanism of action through the inhibition of histamine, an inflammatory mediator, usually released during the early phase of allergic responses and chronic phase of inflammatory pain.

Effect of class imbalance in heterogeneous network embedding: An empirical study,"Harbir Kaur Rao, RS Gupta, SR Singh",2010,Medicine,20,,,"Chronic stable angina is a debilitating illness affecting millions worldwide. Considerable progress has been made over the last 30 years in understanding its pathogenesis. Conventional anti-anginal drugs such as nitrates, β-blockers and calcium channel blockers effect heart rate, blood pressure, pre-load and contractility and thus reduce the oxygen demand. Ranolazine is a new anti-anginal drug approved by the US-FDA for use either as an add-on therapy and now even as a monotherapy. It inhibits the late sodium currents, thereby maintaining sodium–calcium homeostasis and preventing ischaemia induced diastolic dysfunction. Ranolazine does not affect the heart rate, BP and ionotropic state. Antianginal benefits of Ranolazine have been confirmed by various trials (MARISA, CARISA, ERICA, MERLIN TIMI 36 etc.) in addition it exerts anti-arrhythmic effect in acute NSTEMI. Although it prolongs QTc interval but no case of Torsade de pointes has been observed. It significantly lowers HbA1C in diabetics, which represents potential for clinical benefit.
Ivabradineis a pure heart rate lowering agent acting by inhibiting the funny current (If) in the SA node. It doesn’t affect blood pressure, myocardial contractility, intra cardiac conduction or ventricular repolarisation.

Few studies have, however, focused on understanding how these ‘local leaders’ influence employee creativity. While the research exploring the relationship between leadership styles and creativity is scant, there exists even less research analyzing the impact of specific leader behaviors on employee creativity. Moreover, there exists a dearth of studies analyzing the influence of leaders on employee perceptual and psychological processes and eventually their creative performance. Taking leave from the popular two-factor classifications of leadership like transformational-transactional and consideration-initiating structure, the first part of the study identifies important supervisory behaviors that impact employee creativity. The second part presents work motivation (intrinsic and extrinsic motivations), positive psychological capital (self-efficacy, hope, optimism and resilience) and justice perceptions (distributive, procedural and interactional justice perceptions) as important mediating variables for the leadershipcreativity relationship. The paper identifies patterns of behaviors that can influence each of the proposed mediating variables.

Early drought and flood cause delayed planting, resulting in further yield decline. More than 50% of rainfed lowland rice, transplanting is frequently delayed (Mackill et al. 1996). Yield stability is another major problem of rainfed lowland ecosystem. Traditional rice cultivars grown in rainfed lowlands provide stable protection against flood, drought and delayed planting-related problems, but they are less responsive to favourable environments or higher inputs. Drought or flooding often makes it impossible to transplant at optimum age of seedlings. Rice farmers need improved genotypes with better yields and stability under delayed planting conditions across environments. The choice of suitable breeding procedure depends upon the relative magnitude of different kinds of genes and an understanding of the mode of inheritance of complex quantitative characters. Generation means analysis used to estimate the components of genetic variance which provides information about the predominant type of gene action for the different traits under improvement. This analysis is one of the several tools used in estimating additive, dominance and epistatic variations. Literature survey revealed that voluminous work has been done for gene action of various traits in rice (Singh et al. 2004). But reports on lowland rice is very scanty. Furthermore, work on gene action under delayed planting condition is not available.

Entrepreneurship appears in different sizes–from large corporations to small retail shops–and it assumes various forms. For entrepreneurship to flourish mere government support as well as natural resources of that particular region is not adequate enough as it is true that the technology, market, capital and the human resources are imperative for entrepreneurial development, but, it is equally essential that all the activities are coordinated by the spirit of an entrepreneurial mindset. It then appears that the culture of the region as well as the internal drive in a man is an important factor to play in the development of this process. Hence, this paper attempts to explore the motives of entrepreneurs belonging to Jharkhand, a state considered to be suffering with stifling entrepreneurial culture and growth.

A user can move anytime in an ad hoc scenario and, as a result, such a network needs to have routing protocols which can adopt dynamically changing topology. To accomplish this, a number of ad hoc routing protocols have been proposed and implemented, which include Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) and ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing. In this paper, we analyze the performance differentials to compare the above-mentioned commonly used ad hoc network routing protocols. We report the simulation results of three different protocols for wireless ad hoc networks having thirty nodes. The performances of proposed networks are evaluated in terms of number of retransmission attempts, Control traffic sent, Control traffic received, Data Traffic sent, Data Traffic received and throughput with the help of OPNET simulator. Data rate 2Mbps and simulation time 20 minutes were taken. For this above simulation environment, AODV shows better performance over the other two on-demand protocols, that is, DSR and DSDV.",8,"Performance of QoS Parameter in Wireless Ad hoc Network (IEEE 802.11 b)

Birds are successful animal surviving and reproducing under various environmental conditions on the earth. The gonadal activity shows seasonal variation in birds, and is regulated by the interaction between external environmental and internal hormonal factors. Present study has been focused on the observation of the annual body and gonadal weight cycle in Indian Passeriformes finch Lonchura punctulata (Spotted munia). Annual changes in gonadal weight can be used as a parameter for the gonadal activity. The observation shows marked relationship between gonadal weight cycle and seasonal changes. The gonadal weight and histological changes suggest that the seasonal alteration is an effective environmental factor in the regulation of pronounced gonadal development. The effect is manifested by changes in testicular and ovarian weight during annual breeding cycle. The result of annual study suggests parallel increase of body and gonadal weight seasonally. Findings exhibited gonadal regression during winter and the emergent gonadal peak in the reproductive active phase from July to September, 2008.",0,"To study the annual variation in the body and gonadal weight of Indian Passeriformes finch, Lonchura punctulata.

TJamSpotter: Real Time Android App for Road Traffic Management.,"SP Singh, P Singh, P Pathak",2008/7,WATER HARVESTING,,,,"For sustainable crop production system under rainfed condition, the conservation of rainwater and its efficient recycling are imperative. The rainwater can be conserved either in-situ ie in the soil itself or ex-situ in natural or man made structures wherefrom it can be used for supplemental irrigation. In-situ rainwater conservation can be carried out either though tillage or landform management (Singh et al., 2000). Among the various landform management practices like raised and sunken bed, ridges and furrow etc. developed for Vertisols, broad-bed and furrow (BBF) system is very promising in controlling surface runoff, reducing the soil loss through erosion and increasing infiltration (Pathak et al. 1985; Singh et al. 1999). The BBF landform management system reduces the velocity of runoff water and thus increases opportunity time for water to infiltrate and reduces sediment losses. Further, during the period of heavy rainfall the furrows allow excess water to drain safely from the plots and thus avoid water congestion to the crop (Kampen, 1982). There is an urgent need to manage the water resources of Vertisols of Central India to control soil erosion and to improve use efficiency of the rainfall for sustaining crop production. This is possible through adoption of improved land management practices, which will decrease runoff and soil erosion and concomitantly improve crop yield in deep Vertisols.

Sesamin content ranged from 1.76 to 10.46 g/kg oil, sesamolin ranged from 0.72 to 3.77 and {gamma}-tocopherol ranged from 0.45 to 0.77. Average sesamin content was 5.44 g/kg and the sesamolin was 1.92 g/kg, while {gamma}-tocopherol was 0.58 g/kg. Co-efficient of variation for sesamin was 17.99 while it was 15.16 for sesamolin and 12.57 for {gamma}-tocopherol. Top ten mutants were selected for the estimation of lignan profiles. Mutant No.1022 recorded significantly higher total lignan content of 14.23 g/kg as against the parent DS-1 (5.79 g/kg). The mutant also had high amount of sesamin (10.46 g/kg). The top four induced mutants (No.1022, 23, 191 and 983) recorded the total lignan content of more than double compared to the parent DS-1 (5.79 g/kg).

It was found that the sugarcane based farming systems were predominant in the study area. Farmers received net income of Rs. 63496/- per hectare from livestock and crop combinations. The farmers were using surplus fertilizer and chemicals resulting in negative marginal value productivity (MVP). The MVP of credit was found very attractive indicating very good scope to financing agencies to supply agricultural credit to the farmers of the area. The number of dairy animals was found nearly to the optimum (about 3 animals/farm). The farmers employed excess labour about 1300 man days/ha as against the optimum requirement of about 500 man days/ha and there is a large scope to reduce the labour cost in existing farming systems.,0,"Farming Systems Identification and Resource Productivities in Relation to Farm Size in Western Uttar Pradesh

Background: The 2G allele of the MMP1 -1607 1G/2G promoter polymorphism creates an Ets binding site that leads to increased transcriptional and enzyme activity, particularly in the presence of growth factors and cytokines. This polymorphism has been associated with greater risk of cancer (e.g., renal cell, lung and oral cancers, glioblastomas) and cancer invasiveness (e.g., melanoma, cervical, lung and colorectal cancer). The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of this MMP 1G/2G polymorphism in the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). Methods: We evaluated 323 histologically confirmed EA cases and 464 healthy controls frequency-matched for age and gender. Genotyping of the MMP1 1G/2G promoter polymorphism involved a Taqman approach.

But, most of the Web sources are autonomous and updated independently. Clients like Web crawlers are not aware of when and how often the sources change. Unlike other studies, the process of Web page updates is modeled as non-homogeneous Poisson process and focus on determining localized rate of updates. Then various rate estimators are discussed, showing experimentally how precise they are. This paper explores two classes of problems. Firstly the localized rate of updates is estimated by dividing the given sequence of independent and inconsistent update points into consistent windows. From various experimental comparisons, the proposed Weibull estimator outperforms Duane plot (another proposed estimator) and other estimators proposed by Cho et la. and Norman Matloff in 91.5%(90.6%) of the whole windows for synthetic (real Web) datasets. Secondly, the future update points are predicted based on most recent window and it is found that Weibull estimator has higher precision compared to other estimators.",11,"Estimating the Rate of Web Page Updates.

Leaves from three positions were collected on eighteen dates (April to December) at 15 days interval. The content of NPK in the leaves decreases continuously from top to base position of the shoot and thereby giving an average value in the middle ones. The leaves from middle positions of the shoot may therefore, be recommended for sampling to find out the status of NPK contents in olive plants. Over all effect of leaf age on NPK status indicated reduction in N and P contents up to August and increase gradually up to the October.

Addition of GM had definite improvement in glycolysis (1.37-1.39% LA), proteolysis (8.9-11.2% soluble protein) and lipolysis (16.0-43.2 µ. eq FFA/g) of cheddar cheese as compared to the respective values of 1.20% LA, 8.3% soluble protein, and 12.2 µ. eq FFA/g of control cheese, while ME had positive impact on proteolysis (10.8% soluble protein) and lipolysis (36.8 u. eq FFA/g). The proteolysis could be advanced by 2 months through addition of GM or ME while lipolysis could be advanced by 2-4 months. Addition of both GM and ME had synergistic effect on the proteolysis and lipolysis during ripening. GM had definite stimulatory effect on the growth of starter culture (9.0 log cfu/g) and lactobacilli (6.6-6.8 log cfu/g) in BMCC. The samples containing ME showed higher total viable count (8.9 log cfu/g) and lactobacilli count (6.9 log cfu/g) throughout the ripening period. Yeast and mold count and spore count were unaffected by addition of GM or ME or both and did not follow any distinct growth pattern during ripening. Coliform count, on the other hand, decreased with the progress of storage in all the samples. Depending on the availability, addition of GM or ME or both is recommended to accelerate the biochemical and microbiological changes during ripening of BMCC.",0,"Biochemical and Microbiological Changes during ripening of cheddar cheese from buffalo mil supplemented with goat milk and microencapsulated enzymes

Eighteen male Murrah buffalo calves (6-9 months old) were randomly distributed into 3 groups, and fed different isonitrogenous concentrate mixtures (I, II and III) to meet their energy and protein requirement. Concentrate mixture I (control) had maize, while in concentrate II and III maize was replaced with rice polish and deoiled rice polish, respectively. Wheat straw was fed ad libitum. Experimental feeding was done for a period of 120 days. The total body weight gain and average daily gain were significantly (P< 0.05) lower in group III in comparison to control group. The total dry matter intake in group I, II and III was 553.27±4.25, 516.70±9.36, 442.46±4.44, respectively. The feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was ranged between 9.41±0.62 (group I) to 9.93±0.33 (group III) showed no significant difference and indicated that feeding of grainless ration had no adverse effect on FCE.

Fiori & Paol) cropping system in India is being cultivated on an area of 10.5 million ha which contributes approximately 25% in the national food grain production (Gupta 2003). Use of nitrogenous fertilizers, viz urea has played key a role in enhancing the rice-wheat production, yet its use-efficiency in rice is only 3040% or even less (Prasad and Power 1995). Besides, fertilizer use has been sensitive to price relationship, on the other front, soil health and productivity is becoming more important in present paradigm. Therefore, we need fertilizers, which are not only cost effective but also maintain soil health favourably. This could be possible by two ways, firstly, using the inorganic fertilizers which can meet the crop nutrient demand for entire season through single application and secondly, supplementing inorganic fertilizer demand with proper proportions of organic sources. Keeping in view these concerns, present investigations were undertaken to study the effect of prilled urea, biogas slurry, neem oil-treated urea sources and their combinations in various proportions on productivity and economics of rice-wheat cropping system. A field experiment was conducted during the rainy and winter seasons of 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 on sandy clayloam soils of the research farm at Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi (2g040'N latitude, 77"" 1OYE longitude and 228.6 m altitude).

First PC was related with fruits/plant and branches/plant; second PC with yield/ plant, seeds/fruit and test weight third PC with plant height; and fourth PC with days to flowering. The genotypes were grouped into five clusters and cluster II was largest with 5 genotypes followed by clusters I, III and Clusters IV, V. Cluster IV exhibited highest mean for seed yield (14.77g) followed by cluster III (14.53g) and the former incorporated inbred lines, NBCP-53 and NBCP-58 that were highly divergent among themselves and from genotypes in other clusters. The inbred in cluster IV and cluster III with good amount of genetic divergence and superior agronomic traits were identified as promising inbred to develop superior recombinants with desirable agronomic traits.",8,"Multivariate analysis and clustering of Cuphea procumbens inbred lines

Combined effect of hydroethanolic extracts of Murraya koenigii and Phyllanthus niruri leaves on paracetamol and ethanol-induced toxicity in HepG2 cell line,"AI Shugaba, MBT Umar, SP Singh",2006,,,,Journal of Medical Sciences,"The muscosal, luminal and lymphoid follicle diameters of the vermiform appendix were measured in micrometers from the basal, middle and terminal segments and their relationships analyzed and plotted. There is a strong relationship between these diameters, especially between lymphoid follicle diameter and the thickness on one hand and that between the luminal diameter and the lymphoid follicle diameter on the other. The lumen decreases when either the thickness or the lymphoid follicle diameter increase in size, suggesting that obstruction can occur at such sites with the resulting microscopic and macroscopic changes that come to bear on normal subjects. This segmental profile shows that, histomorphological and histomorphometric changes In the appendix are capable of explaining the basis and indeed the likely sites of obstruction in appendicitis.",7,"Histomorphometric Profile of the Human Verniform Appendix

The experiment was conducted in randomized block design (RBD) with five treatments and three replications. Application of fertilizer and FYM significantly increased the herbage yield of lemon grass as compared to control. 40 kg N/ha through urea in combination of FYM@ 2.5 t/ha significantly produced highest yield. Lower yield was recorded due to FYM application as compared to fertilizer but properties of soil improved. Organic carbon,'nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium status of post harvest soil increased due to application of fertilizer and FYM as compared to initial level. However, 2.5 t FYM/ha+ 40 kg N/ha was found to be superior over other treatments in respect of improvement in nutrient status. Bulk density and particle density of post harvest soil were increased by fertilizer application while FYM application decreased.

The yellow stem borer (Sciropophaga incertulas), leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis), white back plant hopper (Sogatella furcifera), some occasional pests and a few diseases are the main constraints in achieving the potential yield levels of scented rice cultivars. Farmers use pesticides to get rid of pest problems with meagre knowledge of proper time of application, quantity etc. and as a result they do not get desired control levels. Moreover, excessive use of insecticides often results in reduction of biodiversity of natural enemies, outbreaks of secondary pests and pesticides induced resurgence. The environmental pollution and residues in grains are the other hazards experienced with the indiscriminate use of pesticides. The holistic integrated pest management (IPM) strategy was developed and validated by the National Centre for IPM on some small farms during 1996-1999. This paper reports on the area-wide IPM implemented in two villages of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana states in a farmers' participatory mode during the years 2000 to 2003.

This paper is primarily directed at teachers and students involved in advanced electromagnetic and RF design studies at the graduate level, for example, courses in microwave engineering, power engineering and biomedical engineering. Typical electromagnetic simulation studies are presented in this paper to illustrate the efficacy and userfriendly nature of the software.",2,"A student-accessible graphical user interface-based FDTD algorithm for visualization of electromagnetic fields

Rainfed lowland is the major rice ecologyinthecountry, combining the characteristics of upland and irrigated systems. The declining and unpredictable rainfall pattern has led to the disappearance of traditional Oryza sativa cultivars. Consequently, farmers now cultivate O. glaberrima, which has good agronomic traits—ie, acceptable grain quality, plant vigor, and resistance to major biotic and abiotic stresses (Pham 1992, Besançon 1993, Adeyemi and Vodouhe 1996, Sie 1999).

Mining FCI from CFP-tree is simply tracing of prefix nodes, which is a straight forward method. The main advantage of this method lies in the used of simple data structures and less computations in mining FCI.

Since vegetable oils are predominantly composed of unsaturated fatty acids they lack the characteristic stability, texture and ﬂavour, imparted by saturated fats. So to provide the same texture, flavour …",1,"Breeding for designer oil seed crops

In this very difficulr to-root species, lack of adventitious rhizogenesis in shoot cuttings creates problem in clonal propagation and mass multiplication. However, significant adventitious pooting has been achieved in softwood juvenile cuttings taken from seedlings. Low concentration (100 ppm) ofIBA enhances induction and growth ofadventitious roots. The technique would help in clonal propagation of Albizia procera especially in case ofhalf-sib progenies ofselected superior genotypes and hybrids ofknown parentage.",0,"IBA PROMOTES ADVENTITIOUS RHIZOGENESIS IN JUVENILE SHOOT CUTTINGS OF ALBIZIA PROCERA

When constraints from seismic reflection and compliance surveys are also included, we find that models where 25--100% of the lower crust is formed by crystallisation in the shallow melt lens and 25--100% of the lower crust crystallises at its final depth can match the observations.

It was felt that the failure was possibly caused by differential propellant rates of flow from the symmetrically placed pair of liquid tanks on either side of the center of mass. Alternatively, even the initial fixed center-of-mass offset could have led to the same outcome. The investigation presented here models the problem as one of attitude motion by separately treating the system mass into two parts: fixed mass structure including the motor tanks and differentially shrinking bodies of liquid propellant. The system with variable mass is assumed to undergo pitching librations under the influence of thrust moments about the shifting center of mass in the orbital plane.

Presently, all over the world, the problem is considered serious. Earlier, the balance was in favour of collective responsibility: more reliance on norms laid down by religion, laws, and codes of conduct. Now, the emphasis is shifting towards, individual responsibility: ethical choices, compromises, moral courage, transparency, accountability, and self-awareness. This demands education and understanding which is possible through exposure to selected masterpieces of literature and their creative interpretation.",5,"Beliefs, Values, and Ethics

The leaded gasoline, used for the study, was having 1.1% vol. benzene and 16.6% vol. total aromatics whereas unleaded gasoline was having 2.2% vol. benzene and 35.2% vol. total aromatics. Engine-out benzene was found to be linearly related to both, benzene and total aromatics content in the gasoline. Effectiveness of catalytic converter for conversion of the engine-out benzene was also studied.

Analysis of variance showed significant differences among the parents and crosses. Greater variability in the parents indicated the possibility of getting higher heterosis in these crosses. None of the crosses showed uniformity in the heterosis for yield components. However, significant positive heterosis to the magnitude of 102.06%(IS-16× Early) followed by 100%(IS-16× Aphuri) for opium yield and 150.29%(Apium× Early) followed by 42.86%(NBRI-5× Early) for seed yield over better parent was observed. The lowest yielding parents in general, produced the highest yielding progeny perhaps, due to their favourable alleles exclusively of the recessive additive genes. The heterosis study comeincingly raised the possibility that a gene introgression breeding strategically based upon the diverse parents like IS-16, Aphuri and Early would ensure multifold increase in yield traits in opium poppy.",5,"Heterosis study revealing the existence of introgression populations in opium poppy.

Mucor mycosis is a dreaded fungal infectioncaused by fungi of the order mucorales and German Rhizipine, Absidia and Mucor.[1] These fungi are usually found in vegetative and organic matter and have minimal intrinsic pathogenicity. However it can cause serious and fatal infection in immunocompromised conditions especially in patients who have diabetic ketoacidosis, viral hepatitis, chronic renal failure and post transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy.[2-4] The usual portal of entry includes infection through inhalation, ingestion, contamination of skin wounds or via vascular channels such as intravenous drips. The clinical presentation of mucor mycosis depending on the portal of entry, includes rhinocerebral, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, disseminated and miscellaneous forms involving isolated organs like bone, heart and kidneys.",3,"Mucormycosis of transplanted kidney

The basis of their discussions was the people-centred forest policies that have emerged in many countries of the region and their objectives of supporting and strengthening participatory forest management to ensure that the needs of mountain people receive the priority they deserve. The policies, along with their constraints and opportunities were discussed in depth, guided by papers provided by the participants themselves. This volume on India is one of 6: the first contained the workshop proceedings themselves, and the other 4 cover studies from China, the Eastern Himalayas, Nepal and Pakistan.

Various anthropometic measurements were taken on each subject who were between 4 and 20 years and the means were obtained at each age group. These means were transformed into percentages of the mature values for that parameter. Head as a rule is advanced in maturity to trunk which in turn is advanced to forearm and upper arm. In the case of lower extremity, foot length is ahead in maturation to lower leg length and the thigh length. In the case of hand and foot, it is the length which is the ahead in maturity to that of its breadth. These sequences of maturation which conform to the general rules of maturation have implications during childhood for manipulation and in child behaviour.",2,"Maturity gradients in Gaddi Rajput boys

It is by its nature a somewhat enigmatic concept and⁄ therefore⁄ not largely amenable to research. Still⁄ it has been possible to develop better understanding. Leader's personality is not so much in focus now. It has shifted to leadership role and tends to shift further to leadership as a process. Distinction between leadership and managerial roles is becoming clearer. Whether leaders are born or made is no longer a serious controversy. It is asserted that leadership success or failure depends more on learning processes and situational contexts. How to interpret the life around and how to promote meaningful action are some of the vital questions which only better understanding can help in answering.

During the normal predesiccation stage (28-45 days after pollination), seed of Brassica napus (cv. Westar) loses Chl rapidly but seed moisture slowly. After a mild freezing stress, there is a rapid loss of moisture from silique walls, followed by accelerated loss of seed moisture. Chl degradation ceases at 35-45% seed moisture.

Inorganic thin films typically have porosity with long tortuous paths leading to low flux. To attain high selectivity and high flux the ideal film would have short one-dimensional pores. Potential applications of such inorganic membranes are in gas separation for oxygen enrichment, purification of natural gases, and sensor materials. In this study mixed monolayers of octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) and a template amphiphile were prepared and deposited on silicon substrates as Langmuir-Blodgett films. The template amphiphiles were homogeneously dispersed within the thin silica matrix on the water surface and following pyrolization formed micro-porous membranes. Controlled pore-size patterning has been attempted by varying the mole fraction of siloxane to template amphiphile. The resultant molecularly thick silica films were characterized by ellipsometry, scanning force microscopy, and impedance measurement. Our results on pore-size patterning and our attempt to engineer micro-porous silica thin films by pyrolysis will be presented.",0,"Controlled pore-size patterning in thin silica film

The premise is that very thin membranes with oriented channels as pores will have a high flux in addition to being highly selective. Applications include: (1) gas separation membranes for oxygen enrichment, partial oxidation, dehydrogenation, and purification of natural gas; (2) refractory catalytic membrane reactors; and (3) molecular recognition sensors. The methodology for making such membranes was to combine Langmuir - Blodgett (LB) technology with sol-gel chemistry to engineer pore channels within the range 3 to 20 K The channel structure was fabricated of amorphous SiO{sub 2} because of its good thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Our approach was to use LB techniques to uniformly place organic molecular spacers throughout a thin silica precursor matrix and apply this film to a substrate. LB films of solid solutions of commercially available silane amphiphiles and organic amphiphiles were fabricated. The siloxane groups were then hydrolyzed to form silica and the organic portions of the amphiphiles removed by thermal decomposition. With the completely fugitive organic spacer amphiphiles removed, a thin silica film with micropores resulted. The pore size was in the range of 6 - 8 {angstrom} and in an ultra-thin configuration. With further development this technique may be useful for fabrication of inorganic membranes which satisfy all the criteria of the ideal membrane.",0,"Oriented inorganic thin film channel structures with uni-directional monosize micropores

A total area of 54,000 square m had to be roughened within 120 days at most. The three trials used:(1) a pneumatic jack hammer;(2) a modified terrazzo cutting machine; and (3) an improvised trolley-mounted pneumatic chipping hammer. During the trials, disadvantages observed in the mechanical roughening systems included starting problems and defects of compressors, defects in pneumatic tools, and blunting and breaking of chisels. There were also trials of manual roughening methods, using an axe-type chiselling hammer and a well-designed chipping hammer. It was found that both mechanical and manual methods of roughening produced an excellent roughened PCC surface. The quality of roughening was so high that, with sufficient care, a very effective bond could be created between old and new concrete. Manual roughening was found to much cheaper than mechanical roughening, and employed many previously unemployed workers for the duration of the project.",0,"A CASE STUDY ON ROUGHENING OF PCC SURFACE FOR A RIGID OVERLAY

It is therefore essential to evolve strategies for enhancing the power supply not only through new projects but also through better utilization of existing sources. Deterioration in coal quality as adversely affected performance of power plants based on PF boilers necessitating beneficiation of non-coking coal involving two product separation in to prepared coal and reject. Operational results of pilot plant and commercial plants based on fluidized bed combustion technology have shown the advantages of this technology and its effectiveness in burning low-calorific value fuels in an environmentally friendly manner. The process of FBC combustion has been demonstrated practically for all the types of coals available in India and provides the answer for power generation from high ash coal and reject from beneficiation plants and thereby ensures conservation of coal resources dwindling at an alarming rate. This paper describes four industrial FBC projects based on washery rejects and coal/lignite. The unique feature of Indian installations is the design basis for burning washery rejects up to 70% ash and HHV of 1,600 Kcal/kg plants have been discussed. Potential of power generation from washery rejects and quantum of coal conserved by installing this capacity has also been worked out in this paper.",0,"Fluidized bed boilers for washery rejects--Operating experience and prospects in India

Effect of class imbalance in heterogeneous network embedding: An empirical study,"Deoki Nandan, N Goel, DN Pandey, S Singh, GD Barnwal",1995/9/30,Indian Journal of Community Health,8,"2, 3",,"Background:
Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) was launched on 12th April 2005, under the umbrella of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) with the main objective of reducing maternal, neo-natal mortality and promoting institutional delivery. It was implemented in all states and UTs with special focus on 10 low performing states (LPS). Uttarakhand is one of the LPS and JSY was implemented here in Sept. 2005.
Objective:
To find out the difference in utilization of Janani Suraksha Yojana in rural areas and urban slums.
Material and Methods:
A cross-sectional study was conducted under Rural Health Training Centre and Urban Health Training Centre of the field practice area of department of Community Medicine. A total of 227 married women in reproductive age (15-49 years), who delivered in government hospital were considered for the study out of which 88 women belonged to rural areas and 139 women were from urban slums.
Results:
Out of the total number of married women who delivered at govt. hospital ie 227, majority (78.42%) were registered with some health personnel. Out of these, 74.15% women were registered with ASHA and maximum number (83.64%) of these women belonged to urban slums. Only 29.21% women went for three or more ANC visits and the proportion was higher (33.64%) in urban slums. Only 48.31% women consumed hundred IFA tablets and the proportion was high (79.41%) in rural women. All the women received complete TT immunization.
Conclusion:
The JSY utilization was found to be low in rural areas ie 38.7%. Thus, IEC activities should be strengthened and ASHA’s work should be properly monitored.",0,"A report of sample survey on births and deaths in agra district

Functional outcomes of sensorimotor balance training as compared to dorsiflexor strengthening in elderly population,"RK Gupta, S Singh",1993,,,,,"[en] Recently, a number of light neutron-rich nuclei, like 11 Li, 14 Be and 17 B, are identified at the neutron-drip line, which show the interesting new structure of forming a kind of halo of the last couple of neutrons around the remaining core nucleus. In the present paper, the authors have studied a highly neutron-rich nucleus 288 104 with a view to identify the possible target-projectile combinations for forming this heavy nucleus at the neutron-drip line. For this purpose, they have calculated the cold fragmentation potential and the formation yields of 288 104 for all the possible target-projectile combinations. Interestingly enough, they find that for cold fusion reactions, in addition to usual one or both closed (or nearly closed) spherical or deformed shell nuclei, 11 Li, 14 Be, 18 C and 22 O are also predicted to be the possible projectiles for forming 288 104. The other cold fusion reactions for forming 288 104 are 130 Cd+ 158 Ba, 98 Kr+ 190 Er, 78 Ni+ 210 Os, 62 Ti+ 226 Pb and 44 S+ 244 Ra.

As with many characterisation techniques, there are limitations on the information obtained by XPS. This has, in part, provided the impetus for developing other techniques which would complement XPS, in terms of both compositional data and surface sensitivity. Static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS) has emerged in the last ten years as one of the most powerful techniques complementary to XPS. As implied by the name of the technique, a mass spectrum representative of the surface is obtained. This chapter will give brief outlines of the two techniques and some of their applications.

Toward the end of infancy, the child shows increasingly greater capability to handle integrated actions. A gesture becomes the vector of organized thought. The perceptual-motor functions of the child begin to have potential application to many situations and assume the characteristic sociodramatic nature of the world in which he or she lives.1Training through education or imitation plays a dominant role in the learning of complex gestures like kissing, naming a body part, or blowing the nose.
True kissing is the ability of the child to press the lips on cheeks with or without sound, on verbal request. It is a complex gesture. Dargassies2has shown that 15% of children at age 12 months and 95% of children at age 15 months attempt to kiss; 24% of children at age 15 months",1,"Kiss: a developmental milestone or a culture-determined skill?

At 17.5 kg P/ha the productivity was highest when all the P was applied to pigeon pea. The response of wheat to N was restricted to 80 kg N/ha, and N applied to wheat had no residual effect on pigeon pea.

Modeling evolution of a social network using temporalgraph kernels,"CD Mistry, S Singh, RS Sharma",1990,Status of some minerals of paneer made from cow milk with altered salt balance.,,,International Dairy Federation,"Paneer is similar to co-precipitates in protein composition and chemical process of manufacture except that the latter is fat-free. Unlike low-, medium-and high-calcium co-precipitates, there are no reports on the systematic status of minerals in paneer. This work is an attempt to study the mineral status of paneer. Paneer was prepared from 3.5%-fat milk containing 0.02%(T1) and 0.05%(T2) calcium sulphate, 0.02%(T3) and 0.05%(T4) disodium hydrogen phosphate, and no added salt (T0), by heating to 82 C for 5 min and coagulating at 82 C with 1%(w/v) citric acid solution. Five replicates of milk and paneer were analysed for Ca, Mg, P and citrate content. Mineral content (mg/100 g) of milk was: Ca, 139.81; Mg, 18.62; P, 80.83; citrate, 289.46; and salt balance ratio, 0.43. Addition of 2.63 or 6.58 mg Ca and 3.47 or 8.71 mg P to raw milk before heating caused subtle changes in salt balance. The combined effect of added salts, heating and acidification brought about a dramatic change in the product characteristics, and reversible shifts in the colloidal to soluble phases of minerals during heating and acidification of milk. Calcium content (% w/w, wet basis) and salt balance ratios were 0.41, 0.50, 0.54, 0.40 and 0.40, and 0.61, 0.68, 0.74, 0.61 and 1.28 resp. for T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 paneer. All the paneer samples could be classified as low-calcium paneer as in low-calcium co-precipitates (0.5 to 0.8% Ca). Increases in ratios of salt balance in T1 and T2 were due to a significant increases in Ca and P but in T3 and T4 paneer the variation was due to significant decrease in P.",1,"Status of some minerals of paneer made from cow milk with altered salt balance.

Interaction Effect of Different Nitrogen and Seed Rate Levels on Sweet Sorghum Feedstuff,SP Singh,1990,Indian Farming,40,5,,"The farmers who cultivate drylands in India have traditionally followed subsistence agriculture, growing crops that show little response to inputs and management. A strategy has been developed at various Dryland Research Centres that produces high yields from semi-arid lands, laying stress on the efficient exploitation of climate, energy, natural resources, scarce finance and available technology. The suitability of land in terms of topographical features and dependable water sources is discussed together with the existence of efficient crops, such as sunflower, pigeon pea and sorghum, the establishment of a good crop stand, critical irrigation, and the use of intercropping techniques. Climatically efficient double crop sequences and intercropping systems for different dryland areas in India are listed.

Since many of the revolutionaries worked secretly and not all of their plans came to fruition, it has been hard to learn of their work unless they wrote memoirs, were carefully tracked by the CID, or were interviewed by scholars prepared to tell their tales.
These two books make a contribution to this fascinating story of secret plotting, organization, assassination, and uprising. SC Sen Gupta's work is largely the tale of the Bengal Volunteers (BV), is based on extensive testimony of survivors, and is written with verve and passion. This is a group about which little is known and so the author has preserved their history for posterity.

By solving the partial differential equations representing the electron–acoustic wave interaction in the piezoelectric semiconducting region, and the Laplace’s equation in the vacuum region separately and fulfilling the relevant boundary conditions, we obtain an expression for the amplification coefficient. The effects of carrier diffusion, resistivity, and carrier drift velocity on the amplification coefficient have been studied based on numerical calculations for the semiconducting CdS sample. It has been observed that, compared to Rayleigh waves, the Bleustein–Gulyaev waves give a much higher amplification.",0,"Amplification of Bleustein–Gulyaev waves in cadmium sulfide

The static electric‐field intensity and the carrier concentration inside the semiconductor are taken as nonuniform even in trap‐free samples. This assumption used in our theory modifies the results obtained by the earlier theories considerably. It is also found that the power thus calculated for the second harmonic flux in terms of the power associated with the fundamental flux is enhanced. Comparison with the available experimental results shows a qualitative agreement. We have used the phenomenological theory and that restricts our analysis to the low frequency region.,5,"Acoustic second harmonic generation in piezoelectric semiconductors: Effect of nonuniform electric field intensity

The terms used are given in ref. 7. In the present case, zone-melting studies were made with a mixture containing 1 wt.% CuClt and the zone length was 3.0 cm. The zone velocity was 1.22 cm h-I. The concentration of cupric chloride vs. distance indicates that cupric chloride moved in the direction of zone travel. Since the concentration varies wiAth distance, it was concluded that the equation for complete mixing is not valid in the present case. Log (1-C/C,) was plotted against distance X to test the validity of eqn.(2). A straight line is not obtained, indicating that the equation for the non-mixing is also not applicable. From the above it appears that cellular or dendritic growth is occurring at the interface.

Two measures of disequilibrium have been used. One is the determinant of the matrix of the gametic frequencies and the other is the difference in the frequencies of coupling and repulsion heterozygotes. Based on some models, numerical solutions for the approach to equilibrium under linkage and selection have been obtained. It has been found that the equilibrium values of the two measures of disequilibrium do not become zero in all cases. The rate of approach to equilibrium is found to be dependent on the intensity of linkage, tight linkage prolonging the approach to equilibrium. Although coupling and repulsion heterozygotes become equally numerous in the population, it is possible that the equilibrium value of ‘d’ need not be zero in epistatic models. Differences in fitnesses between the coupling and repulsion heterozygotes quicken attainment of equilibrium when the homozygotes as well as single heterozygotes have equal fitnesses.",0,"Disequilibrium due to linkage in self-fertilized populations

Sugarcane seed composition and changes during artificial ageing,"SP Singh, TP Singh",1980/7/1,Endokrinologie,76,1,,"Effect of homoplastic hypothalamic extract (HHE) on the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland of three aquatic animals--the fish, Clarias batrachus, the amphibian, Rana tigrina and the reptile, Natrix piscator was studied. Release of prolactin from the pituitary gland in the above animals was blocked within 4 hours by CG 603 (100 microgram/g body wt.) injection. Administration of HHE and perphenazine (15 microgram/g body wt.) in such animals resulted in significantly increased level of prolactin in the blood serum within one hour of treatment indicating an accelerated release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. Injection of cerebral cortical extract failed to induce such response in any of the specimens. From the findings of the present experimentation it is evident that the hypothalamus in C. batrachus, R. tigrina and N. piscator contained predominantly prolactin-release stimulatory factor (PRF) at the time of assessment. Probably in the aquatic poikilotherms where prolactin is not essential for their survival in hypophysectomized condition, hypothalamus contains PRF at least for some period in a year.",3,"Regulation of prolactin secretion by hypothalamus in some cold blooded vertebrates.

Despite its introduction into cultivation of several southeast Asian countries, neither high yielding lines nor improved cultivation practices are determined. Thus, improvement studies on this crop were taken up at the Bureau and the results are presented here. The crop exhibit, variation in colour of flowers such as pink, white and several intermediate forms. We hold collections from wild growing populations found in coastal tracts of India and data on their evaluation for several economic traits are presented. In general, pink flowered plants gave higher yield and white flower types were found succeptible to mycoplasma disease. The crop yield was considerably increased on containing reproductive phase by defloration and detopping. However, detopping was found better and gave 63% and 58% higher foliage and root yield, the increase in alkaloid in root was around 20%. Further there was an alround increase in yield on nitrogen application. However, the overall yield was 40; higher at 80 kg/ha level whereas increase in total alkaloids content more or less stabilized at 40 kg/ha level. Age is another parameter which affected crop yield. An overall increase in yield was registered from 200 days onwards to 290 days. The root yield was significantly high up to 260 days age and basal stems increased further progressively till 290 days. The foliage yield, on the contrary, showed a downward trend till 260 days but rose significantly if harvesting was delayed up to 290 days.

Surface soil samples (0-15 cm depth) collected from four fields put to rice cultivation every year, were air-dried and crushed to pass through a 20 mesh sieve. The properties of these soils are given in table 1. These soils remain waterlogged for a period of four to six months in a year. The soils (10 g for Mn and 5 g for Fe) contained in several 30 ml specimen tubes were waterlogged to a depth of 5 cm and incubated in dark at room temperature. Duplicate samples were drawn at the start of the experiment and at intervals of 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 12 weeks for the estimation of water soluble, exchangeable, active and inactive Fe and water soluble, exchangeable, easily reducible and active Mn (Motomura & Yokoi 1969; Jackson 1967).

Two different freight cars are used for the study. The peak to peak roll angle of the carbody, center plate loads, wheel loads and accelerations are investigated for different track errors and combinations thereof. It is found that track classification according to irregularities and speed limit is not appropriate. This type of classification does not identify the severity of dynamic loads to which the track and vehicle components are subjected. Also, in some cases vehicles will perform better at speeds greater than the specified limit and are subjected to undesirable conditions when operated within the speed limit.",0,"TRACK STRUCTURES-VOLUME IV.

The influence of the dependence of the dielectric constant on the strain was considered in the approximation given by Pekar and Ogg. As a result, a transducer gain proportional to an applied dc field has been obtained. With respect to the frequency responses, an increased output at higher odd harmonics as compared to transducers on piezoelectric crystals was found. The transducers are shown to be tunable because of a stiffening of the surface‐wave velocity by the applied field. Thus, amplitude modulation and frequency modulation should be possible in a simple manner.",1,"Surface‐wave generation in crystals with high dielectric constant

About 60% of the final grain yield was built up due to the assimilatory acti vitiesofthe ear (10%) and the leaves (50%) and 25% was contributed by the leaf sheaths and stem surface. Upper five leaves made larger contribution to the grain yield than the lower ones;: flag leaf alone contributed (13%) as much as the tbtal contribution of all the lower leaves below 5th leaf. The data suggest that the ear of bajra draws upon the photo synthates from almost every photosynthesising plant organ during grain filling period.,0,"CONTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT PHOTOSYNTHETIC SITES TO GRAIN YIELD IN PENN/SETUM TYPHOIDES

The interaction of electrons with the acoustic wave is taken into account through piezoelectric coupling. In contrast to earlier works, we use the collision term, given by Sharma and Kaw which is valid for energy‐dependent relaxation times and use it to solve the Boltzmann equation. Our calculations show that the values of the second harmonic yield for various values of ql differ significantly for ql≪1 and are close for ql≫1 with the corresponding values obtained by using the Cohen‐Harrison‐Harrison (CHH) collision model. Further, the second harmonic yield has a maximum at ql≫1.",5,"Acoustic harmonic generation in piezoelectric semiconductors with energy‐dependent relaxation times

The Boltzmann transfer equation has been used to obtain the gain constant. The results show that the percentage change in the gain constant is ∼15% (for ql<1, Eac=3 V/cm, Ω/ω=0.1, <vd>=1.5 vs) and ∼30% (for ql≳1, Eac=30 V/cm, Ω/ω=2, <vd>=2.0 vs) for moderate strengths of oscillating electromagnetic field (OEF).

Modeling evolution of a social network using temporalgraph kernels,"Shree Pal Singh, Dharampal Singh",1971/12/1,Canadian Journal of Genetics and Cytology,13,4,NRC Research Press,"A complete diallel cross involving four experimental strains and six standard cultivars of Indian mustard. Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. and Coss., was investigated for the inheritance of leaf length and leaf width. Considerable heterosis and heterobeltiosis were found in certain hybrid combinations for both characters. Several crosses exceeded the performance of the best cultivar. Partial dominance for leaf length and overdominance for leaf width were observed. Highly significant additive gene effects were found for both characters bur only about one third of the total variance exhibited by leaf length and about one sixth of that by leaf width may be ascribed to this component. The correlation between the two characters was positive. It was concluded that breeding programs should put more emphasis on leaf length rather than leaf width for effective manipulations of leaf size.",2,"Diallel analysis of leaf characteristics in Indian mustard

The bitter leaves are used in Ayurveda for the treatment of rheumatism, sciatica and intestinal worms (Chopra, Nayar & Chopra 1956). Seeds are recommended as a diaphoretic and diuretic and for the cure of scurvy. Lal & Dutta (1933) did not find any alkaloid in the leaves as reported by earlier workers but obtained D-mannitol and a bitter, amorphous glucoside, mp 71, which was not investigated further. The isolation of an essential oil, benzoic acid, hentriacontane, B-amyrin and B-sitosterol from the petroleum ether extract of the leaves has been reported earlier by Sen & Singh (1964).
Isolation of the flavonoid constituents A concentrated alcoholic extract of the leaves, on keeping in the cold, deposited D-mannitol, which was filtered. The mother liquor was extracted with petroleum ether and benzene. The benzene-insoluble syrup was diluted with water and repeatedly partitioned with n-butanol, thus concentrating the glycosidic constituents in the solvent layer. The dirty brown residue from the butanol extract was purified by dissolving in alcohol and precipitating the impurities preferentially with ether and petrol ether. Removal of the solvent gave a bitter, orange coloured powder. This was then treated with lead acetate in alcoholic solution and the precipitated lead salt filtered. The filtrate was freed of lead and worked up in the usual way to give the glycosides as an yellowish-orange powder.",6,"Flavonoids of Nyctanthes arbor-tristis Linn

Most existing studies in word level language identification are not suitable for low resource languages due to the unavailability of required resources like dictionaries, annotated resources, parsers, taggers etc. This paper aims to address the problem of word level language identification for low resource languages in a highly multilingual environment. Different word level language identification strategies are proposed and their performances are evaluated over a corpus of code-mixed transliterated text consisting of four languages-Assamese, Bengali, Hindi and English. From the experimental observations, it is evident that the proposed framework can effectively handle out-of-vocabulary and shared vocabulary problem which are major challenges for language identification over social media text in a multilingual environment. The proposed framework also uses minimal resources making it suitable for low resource languages.",0,"Identifying Languages at the Word Level in Assamese-Bengali-Hindi-English Code-Mixed Social Media Text

Gene action and combining ability analyses to develop NPT based rice hybrids in Chhattisgarh plains,"Rajlakshmi Saikia, Sanasam Ranbir Singh, Priyankoo Sarmah",,,,,,"Automatic spoken language identification systems are usually built by extracting suitable acoustic features from speech samples, and in some cases by building a language dependent speech-to-text. Acoustic features are highly vulnerable to recording environments and recording channels, often affecting performance. On the other hand, building language dependent speech-to-text synthesizer is a resource intensive and expensive task. Instead of using language dependent speech-to-text transcribers for language identification, this paper investigates the efficacy of using language independent speech-to-text transcribers (trained on languages different from the target languages) in automatic language identification for various Indian languages (namely Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Gujarati, Manipuri, Mizo, Tamil and Telegu) deploying various text classification methods. It further compares the performances obtained over text generated by language independent transcribers with that of the classifiers built using audio features and manually transcribed text. From various experimental setups over speech samples recorded under controlled (studio recorded) and uncontrolled environment (outdoor recording), it is evident that transcription text using language independent transcriber can effectively be used for spoken language identification tasks..",0,"Effectiveness of using language independent transcribers for spoken language identification for different Indian languages

The water permeability of the membranes decreased with the dipping time in hexane. It showed that the rate of decrement in water permeability was about ten times for PS-24 (prepared from 24%, w/w solution in DMF) compared to PS-15 (prepared from 15%, w/w solution in DMF) while the% solute (macromolecule) rejection was decreased by about 11–17% for the membranes.

Nano-formulations of arteether have been developed. The relative bioavailability (RB%) was assessed by calculating individual AUC0‒t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax values. Haematological, biochemical parameters were estimated in rats 15 and sections of brain and peripheral organs were analyzed for histopathological changes. The formulations were tested for antimalarial efficacy and safety in Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis infected swiss mice. The AUC in case of lipid formulations (AUC0-t 4.98±0.79 h. µg/ml) and AUC0-∞(5.02±0.80 h. µg/ml) 20 were significantly higher (p< 0.05) than AE in ground nut oil (GNO) and AE aqueous suspension. The Cmax was also significantly higher for all the formulations. The RB% has been found to be significantly high (257%) in formulations with respect to AE in GNO. No considerable changes have been 25 monitored in the serum biochemical parameters in rats. These formulations have been found to be highly effective against Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis infected swiss mice even at the lower dose of 12.5 mg/kg x5 days. Overall the developed formulations are safe and provide a non-toxic platform for further 30 clinical studies and can be used in artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).

Glucose as carbon source gave 2.9 and 6.8 times higher total selenium removal at neutral pH and 30 oC as compared to lactate and acetate at 2.0 g L-1 COD. Total selenium removal efficiencies of 79±3 and 86±1% were achieved, respectively, in shake flasks and batch reactors at a dissolved oxygen (DO)> 4.0 mg L− 1 and 30 oC when fed with 172 mg L− 1 Na2SeO3 and 2.0 g L− 1 chemical oxygen demand (COD) of glucose. Continuous reactors operated at neutral pH and 30 oC removed 33.98 and 36.65 mg of total selenium per g of total suspended solids (TSS) at TSS concentrations of 1300 and 3000 mg L− 1, respectively.

An approach for grammatical constructs of Sanskrit language using morpheme and parts-of-speech tagging by Sanskrit corpus,"Shail Prakash Singh, Rashmi Pandey",,,,,,"Time-domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) has advantages in spectral efficiency and synchronization. However, its iterative interference cancellation algorithm will suffer from performance loss especially under severely fading channels with long delays and has difficulty supporting high-order modulations like 256 QAM, which may not accommodate the emerging ultra-high definition television service. To solve this problem, a channel estimation method for OFDM under the framework of compressive sensing (CS) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, by exploiting the signal structure of recently proposed time-frequency training OFDM scheme, the auxiliary channel information is obtained. Secondly, we propose the auxiliary information based subspace pursuit (A-SP) algorithm to utilize a very small amount of frequency domain pilots embedded in the OFDM block for the exact channel estimation. Moreover, the obtained auxiliary channel information is adopted to reduce the complexity of the classical SP algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the CS-based OFDM outperforms the conventional dual pseudo noise padded OFDM and CS-based TDS-OFDM schemes in both static and mobile environments, especially when the channel length is close to or even larger than the guard interval length, where the conventional schemes fail to work completely.",0,"Compressive Sensing for OFDM Systems Based Channel Estimation under Long Delay Channels

Growth and developmental behaviour of Lipaphis erysimi (Kalt.) at leaf and flowering stages on different mustard genotypes.,"Dinesh Prasad, MP Singh, SR Singh",,,,,,"As a matter of fact, the capacity of any warehouse is limited, so a firm has to hire a warehouse called rented warehouse (RW) for storing the excess units over the fixed capacity W (say) of the own warehouse (OW). Practically the RW is assumed to offer better storing facilities than the OW, which results in a lower rate of deterioration and is supposed to charge higher holding cost than the OW. In this paper a two-warehouse inventory model for deteriorating items is considered with linearly time varying demand under the permissible delay in payments. Also we assumed that the interest charged by the supplier after trade credit period is not necessarily higher than the interest earned as the retailer may invest the revenue in different schemes that may give better return (eg in share market, mutual fund, real estate etc). The purpose of this paper is to find the optimal replenishment policy to minimize the total relevant inventory cost. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the proposed model.

Secure and efficient integrity algorithm based on existing SHA algorithms,"SP Singh, RK Tripathi",,,,,,"A major drawback in case of three-level PWM rectifiers is unbalance in DC-bus capacitor voltage which is further aggravated under unbalanced load conditions. The DC-bus capacitor voltage unbalancing is created due to irregular charging and discharging of the capacitor which is originated by asymmetric connections produced by power semiconductor devices in the converter. The capacitor voltage unbalancing has become a burning issue and has invited an intensive research to address this problem in multilevel inverters. The key aspect in the behavior of multilevel rectifiers is to avoid the unbalance in DC-bus capacitor voltages.
In the proposed work, a linear controller is used to control the total DC-bus voltage in a similar fashion as in twolevel PWM rectifiers. A non-linear controller is proposed to achieve the balancing of the DC-bus capacitor voltages. In fact, the mechanism which generates the DC-bus capacitor voltage unbalancing is studied and is used to develop the proposed control algorithm. The redundant switching vectors are used for achieving the capacitor voltage balancing.

PCR Array Based Approach to Find IL-6/STAT3 Mediated Downstream Target Genes Involved in the Skeletal Pathogenesis of Hyper-IGE Syndrome,"Priyanka Sharma, Simar Preet Singh",,,,,,"The mobile ad hoc network is the network in which mobile nodes are free to move in any direction without any central control. When these nodes combine they form a network. The VANET comes under the MANET as one of its type. The smart cars in VANET moves freely in the city area. There are two types of communication possible in VANET ie vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure. The smart cars ie the intelligent vehicles are defined respective to their distance, direction and speed analysis. If there is any accident happened in that network then the node sends this information to its neighbour node and like this the information is spread in all over the network. Similarly at the time of handoff one RSU sends the information to next RSU, so that the required information of node’s speed, directions, distance is known to the RSU in advance and hence help in reducing the delay at the time of handoff. In this there is a RSU which is attached to the main server. The vehicles communicate with radio waves and vehicle send the information of accident to the RSU which transfers it to the main server and the main server broadcast it to the other RSUs so that all the mobile nodes get this information. The servers replicate and send this information to all vehicles and the vehicles can change their direction and choose other path to reach their destination. In this paper, beacon frame range of RSU and threshold value has been discussed which helps in creating a synchronized relationship between road side unit which can help in reducing delay of packets and increasing throughput at the time of handoff of node from one road side unit to next road side unit.",0,"A Novel Delay Optimization Technique in VANET using Beacon Frame Range

An experimental programme was planned in which beam specimens of size 100 mm x 100 mm x 500 mm were tested under three point static flexural loading to obtain the flexural strength of SCFRC. In addition, cube specimens of size 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm were also tested on 2000 kN compression testing machine to obtain compressive strength of specimens. The mix containing different fibre volume fractions of steel fibres at 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5%, each volume fraction incorporating 15%, 30% and 45% fly ash as partial replacement of cement were prepared. In addition, a few SCC (no fibres) mixes containing 15%, 30% and 45% fly ash as partial replacement of cement were also prepared. The flexural toughness parameters were obtained using procedure laid down in ASTM C-1018, JCI Method and ASTM C-1609/M. The results indicate that maximum increase in compressive strength as well as flexural strength over that of control concrete mix (SCC with 15% fly ash) is obtained for SCFRC containing 1.5% volume fraction of fibres at 15% of fly ash as partial replacement of cement. The maximum value of flexural toughness was obtained for SCFRC mix containing 1.5% volume fraction of fibres at 30% of fly ash as partial replacement of cement.",0,"STRENGTH AND FLEXURAL TOUGHNESS OF SELF COMPACTING FIBRE REINFORCED CONCRETE

The work includes performance review of three recommended detailing systems namely, L-type (SP1), inverted U-type with corner stirrups (SP2), U-bars lap spliced with the main reinforcement (SP3) and on the basis of observed behavior, a modified detailing arrangement, to be used in the corner joints subjected to opening moment has been recommended. The experimental work consisted of testing nominally identical planer portal-type opening corner specimens made of normal strength concrete under monotonically increasing static loads. The results obtained are analysed in terms of crack widths, ultimate load and corner efficiencies of the specimens.",0,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCES & RESEARCH TECHNOLOGY REINFORCEMENT DETAILING FOR OPENING CORNERS

Studies on the Leachate Characteristics of Compacted Fly Ash Bed Treated with Lime Column,"MD Newlands, Ravindra K Dhir, SP Singh",,,,,,"The paper is concerned with selecting materials for concrete that is both durable and sustainable and the issues associated with achieving this. The paper starts by reviewing the current situation in standards and then progresses to consider the work of several studies exploring sustainability options for concrete (through novel cement combinations, efficiency in mix proportioning and alternative aggregates) and their influence on various aspects of durability (including carbonation rates, chloride ingress and freeze/thaw attack). It is demonstrated that these can be used to effectively match the performance of conventional concrete. The paper then explores the relationship between durability (chloride ingress) of various cement combination concretes and their environmental impact (measured in terms of embodied CO2 (ECO2)). This suggests that there is likely to be the need for some compromise in achieving performance and lowest ECO2. It is also noted that some of the low ECO2 concretes require longer times to attain the early strength necessary for structural applications. Thus factors relating to construction may also need to be included when considering durability and sustainability in the material selection process.",0,"COMBINING DURABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY IN MATERIAL SELECTION FOR CONCRETE

Performance investigation of SVPWM controlled diode clamped and flying capacitor multilevel converters,"S Biswal, T Prakash, C Bohidar, SP Singh",,,,,,"Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) is a method of formative the most efficient, economical and reliable operation of a power system by dispatching available electricity generation resources to supply load on the system. The prime objective of economic dispatch is to minimize total cost of generation while honouring operational constraints of available generation resources. In this paper an intelligent water drop (IWD) algorithm has been proposed to solve ELD problem with an objective of minimizing the total cost of generation. Intelligent water drop algorithm is a swarm-based nature-inspired optimization algorithm, which has been inspired from natural rivers. A natural river often finds good paths among lots of possible paths in its ways from source to destination and finally find almost optimal path to their destination. These ideas are embedded into the proposed algorithm for solving economic load dispatch problem. The main advantage of the proposed technique is easy to put into practice and capable of finding feasible near global optimal solution with less computational effort. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it has been tested on 6-unit system. Arithmetical results show that the proposed method has good convergence property and better in quality of solution than PSO reported in recent literature.",0,"Intelligent Water Drop and Swarm
