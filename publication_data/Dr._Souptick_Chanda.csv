Does preclinical analysis based on static loading underestimate post-surgery stem micromotion in THA as opposed to dynamic gait loading?,"Adeline S Vio War, Neeraj Kumar, Souptick Chanda",2023/2/10,Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"The success of cementless hip stems depends on the primary stability of the implant quantified by the amount of micromotion at the bone-stem interface. Most finite element (FE)–based preclinical studies on post-surgery stem stability rely on static analysis. Hence, the effect of dynamic gait loading on bone-stem relative micromotion remains virtually unexplored. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research on the primary stability of grooved stems as opposed to plain stem design. The primary aim of this FE study was to understand whether transient dynamic gait had any incremental effect on the net micromotion results and to further draw insights into the effects of grooved texture vis-à-vis a plain model on micromotion and proximal load transfer in host bone.

A preclinical model of post-surgery secondary bone healing for subtrochanteric femoral fracture based on fuzzy interpretations,"Pratik Nag, Souptick Chanda",2022/7/21,Plos one,17,7,Public Library of Science,"Mechanobiology plays an essential role in secondary bone fracture healing. While the introduction of newer type of plates, e.g. locking plate (LP), is becoming increasingly popular for complex femoral fractures, the conventional technique involving dynamic compression plate (DCP) remains the standard choice. The difference between the two techniques lies primarily in their screw fixation mechanisms. The present study applied 3D dynamic fracture healing scheme modelled on a subtrochanteric femur fracture, regulated by both finite element (FE) analysis and Fuzzy logic control in order to understand the spatio-temporal healing phenomena for both LP and DCP. The study further examined the influence of the two screw fixation mechanisms in determining the comparative progression of fracture healing. The problem was solved iteratively in several healing steps running in loop and accordingly, the local tissue concentrations and material properties were updated. The predicted results accorded well with various previous experimental observations. The study found an initial delay in healing associated with DCP. However, as the healing progressed, there was no significant difference in overall callus modulus. The presented preclinical model may further help predict bone healing for different implantation techniques, and thus can serve as a non-invasive tool for evaluating relative merits of extramedullary plating techniques.",0,"A preclinical model of post-surgery secondary bone healing for subtrochanteric femoral fracture based on fuzzy interpretations

Uncemented porous coated acetabular components have gained more research emphasis in recent years compared to their cemented counterparts, largely owing to the natural biological fixation they offer. Nevertheless, sufficient peri-prosthetic bone ingrowth is essential for long-term fixation of such uncemented acetabular components. The phenomenon of bone ingrowth can be predicted based on mechanoregulatory principles of primary bone fracture healing. Literature review reveals that the surface texture of implant plays a major role in implant-bone fixation mechanism. A few insilico models based on 2-D microscale finite elements (FE) were reported in literatures to predict the influence of surface texture designs on peri-prosthetic bone ingrowth.

Shape Optimization of Cementless Femoral Implant Using Genetic Algorithms,Souptick Chanda,2015,,,,,"Failure mechanisms, such as implant-induced adverse bone remodelling, excessive implant-bone interface stresses and lack of primary stability, are known to affect the outcome of cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). These failure mechanisms are reported to be influenced by the design of femoral implant. Employing shape optimization as pre-clinical design tool, stem geometries can be evaluated based on these failure objectives. However, the biomechanical causes of failure may sometimes be mutually conflicting. Therefore, it is necessary to implement multiobjective shape optimization scheme to tackle the design conflict and subsequently, attain tradeoff designs by compromising on the design objectives. An experimental study using digital image correlation (DIC) was first carried out in order to develop and validate reasonably accurate 3-D finite element (FE) models of intact and implanted femurs. The FE models of the intact and implanted femurs were developed by replicating the orientation, loading and boundary conditions of the tested specimens.

Understanding how bone strain is influenced by implantation may help explain the cause of periprosthetic bone adaptation [1]. The objective of this study was to measure surface strain data in intact and implanted composite femurs using DIC, and to assess whether it is related to clinically observed bone density changes.
Composite left-femurs (Sawbone AB) were used to assess intact and implanted strain under representative gait loading. The implanted case used an uncemented hip stem (Furlong HAC). A random speckle pattern was applied on the surface of both femurs. The specimens were potted and fixed to the base of an Instron5569 electromechanical testing machine. The undeformed and deformed speckle pattern was photographed using 2MP dual digital cameras, ie before and after application of a 700N static force applied on the femoral head. VIC 3D software (Correlated Solutions Inc., USA) was then used to calculate the strain fields. One-to-one comparison of strains generated in the intact and implanted femur was performed. Five repeat measurements at each location produced an experimental error of<±53µε. The quantitative difference in von Mises strains between the intact and implanted femurs was compared to clinically observed bone remodelling in 7 defined Gruen zones (GZ) in a similar implant system.",2,"Prediction of Bone Remodeling after Total Hip Arthroplasty Using Digital Image Correlation on an Analogue Bone Model

Combined influence of material properties of bone and implant on bone growth over macro-textured implant surface,"Rajdeep Ghosh, Souptick Chanda, Debabrata Chakraborty",,,,,,"Methods: Using coupled linear elastic eight-noded hexahedral finite elements, 3D FE models of macro-textured implant-bone interface based on discernible textures on CORAIL and SP-CL femoral stems were generated in ANSYS V14. 5 FE software (Ansys Inc.). The host bone, implant, and granulation tissue were all considered to be linearly elastic, homogenous, and isotropic. The Young's moduli of cancellous bone was considered 5.3 GPa for the first instance and 7.8 GPa in the second instance and that of Titanium-alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) implant was 113 GPa and Cobalt-alloy (Co-Cr) implant was 210 GPa. The modulus of granulation tissue was considered 1 MPa initially. The Poisson's ratio for bone and implant was set to 0.3, whereas the granulation tissue Poisson's ratio was set to 0.167. All of the model's interfaces were considered perfectly bound. MSCs were thought to be abundant towards the bone surface. Using a numerical framework developed earlier (Ghosh et al., 2020); bone growth percentage was predicted over 120 iterations (120 post-operative days) by updating material properties in the interface tissue iteratively through a tissue differentiation algorithm that works on the principle of mechanotransduction driven by local mechanical stimuli.
Results and Discussion: The present study focusses on the combined influence of material properties of cancellous bone and metallic implant on bone growth over macro-textured implant surfaces. Results from present study show that there is very insignificant variation in bone growth with wide variation in implant elastic modulus as well as cancellous bone property for both the models.

Biomechanical assessment of bone growth over femoral implant with proximal macro-textured surfaces,"Rajdeep Ghosh, Ankan Hazra, Souptick Chanda, Debabrata Chakraborty",,,,,,"Methods: A 3D finite element (FE) model of the left proximal femur was developed from a CT-scan dataset (512 x 512 pixels, pixel size of 0.707 mm and slice thickness of 0.625 mm) of a female patient (35 years, mass 58 kg) using medical image processing program and importing it to ANSYS (v2020 R2) FE software. The implant was developed using SolidWorks® software. Osteotomy of the bone and virtual implantation (Fig. 1a) was performed in Rhinoceros v7. 0. The bone was considered linear elastic, isotropic with site-specific heterogeneity (Fig. 1b) extracted from the CT images using Bonemat v3. 2. Implant material is high-nitrogen stainless steel alloy M30NW (Aubert & Duval, France) with Young’s modulus, E= 195 GPa. A layer of granulation tissue surrounding the implant is modelled with Young’s modulus, E= 1 MPa. The Poisson’s ratios of bone, implant and granulation tissue are considered 0.3, 0.3 and 0.167 respectively. The distal end of the femur was constrained in all directions while a hip contact force of 1664.24 N [2] was applied at the top surface of the femoral component. FE analysis of the femur-implant system (Fig. 1a, 1b) was carried out and bone growth was predicted by a previously developed [1] mechanoregulation based tissue differentiation algorithm.
Results: Results from the present study report the variation in the amount of bone formation at different regions of the macro-textures with significant variation in the amount of bone growth (~ 5.6% to~ 14%) towards the trochanteric region which favoured softer fibro-cartilage as compared to distal regions of the textured surface.
Discussion: The present research thus infers that …",0,"Biomechanical assessment of bone growth over femoral implant with proximal macro-textured surfaces

Proximal Femoral Locking Plate: The Effect of Interface Conditions on Implant-induced Stress Shielding,"Pratik Nag, Souptick Chanda",,Stainless steel,193,,,"Proximal femoral locking plate (PFLP) is an extramedullary implant used in fixation of subtrochanteric and intertrochanteric femoral fracture. However, the fact whether PFLP is better than other fixation methods remains debatable. One important biomechanical parameter that affects adverse bone adaptation is the implant induced stress shielding of bone. The primary aim of this study was to understand the load transfer mechanism in a subtrochanteric femur fracture fixated with PFLP implant under physiological loading (F= 3kN). The 3D finite element (FE) models of the implanted and the intact femur were generated using the manufacturer supplied CAD model of a left femur. After analysis, it was found that the percentage stress shielding in the calcar cortical region of the bonded and the contact model was 24.5% and 49.18%, respectively. The maximum displacement for the intact model was~ 0.74 mm and the same for the bonded and contact model were found to be~ 0.685 mm and~ 0.687 mm, respectively. The maximum stress in the plate was predicted to be 54.56 kPa for the bonded model and that for the contact model was 42.78 kPa. In screws, the maximum stress values for the bonded and the contact models were 138.33 kPa and 107.96 kPa, respectively. It was also observed that the maximum stresses in both the cortical and the cancellous bone of the intact model were lesser compared to that of the respective bones in bonded and contact models.",0,"Proximal Femoral Locking Plate: The Effect of Interface Conditions on Implant-induced Stress Shielding

A Numerical Study on the Possibilities of Cemented Short-Stem Ceramic Femoral Resurfacing Implant,"Kaushik Mukherjee, Bidyut Pal, Souptick Chanda, Debatri Ghosh, Sanjay Gupta",,,,,,"Short-stem resurfaced femoral implant has been found to be a promising alternative to the long-stem design, due to reduced risk of initial femoral neck fracture and more physiological load transfer. he clinical effect of metal ion release and continued concerns regarding the use of Metal-on-Metal bearing warrants an investigation of an alternative material, like ceramics, as a low-wear bearing couple. he objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a short-stem ceramic resurfacing implant, in comparison with the metallic design, with regard to stress-strain related failure mechanisms and bone adaptation. he maximum principal (tensile) stress in the ceramic implant, occurring at the stem-cup junction, was found to increase from 73 MPa at the post-operative condition to 86 MPa after bone remodelling. However, the tensile stresses generated in the cement mantle were low, around 3 MPa. he elevated bone strains occurring at the proximal femoral neck-cup junction region were progressively reduced with bone remodelling. Bone density distribution inside the femoral head was found to be similar to those for the metallic short-stem design. Although bone resorption, 50− 90% reduction in bone density was predominantly observed at the supero-proximal femoral head, bone apposition, 10–30% increase in bone density occurred in the other regions of the femoral head. Apart from better wear resistivity and chemically inert nature of ceramics, it appears from this study that alumina ceramic is a viable alternative to the metallic design.",0,"A Numerical Study on the Possibilities of Cemented Short-Stem Ceramic Femoral Resurfacing Implant
