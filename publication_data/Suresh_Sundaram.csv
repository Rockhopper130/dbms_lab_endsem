Modified sparse representation classification framework for online writer identification,"Vivek Venugopal, Suresh Sundaram",2021,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",51,1,IEEE,"In this paper, we propose a modified strategy using sparse representation to identify the authorship of online handwritten documents. The note-worthy aspect of this paper lies in the introduction of a-priori information for each dictionary atom, that in a way indicates its degree of importance with respect to the dynamic characteristics of the writer. The methodology behind obtaining this information for the dictionary atoms is based on the computation of entropy values over histograms that are generated from the sparse coefficients during the training phase. The prelearned values are incorporated on the traditional schemes of “max” and “mean” pooling of sparse codes, thereby resulting in a modified writer descriptor. Experiments performed with the proposed sparse classification strategy on the handwritten samples of the IAM and IBM-UB1 online handwriting databases demonstrate promising results.",12,"Modified sparse representation classification framework for online writer identification

Online Signature Verification using Time Warp Edit Distance based kernel,"Sarojit Auddya, Rajat Kumar Singh, Suresh Sundaram",2020/9/8,,,,IEEE,"In this paper, we propose a new method for dynamic signature verification. We adapt a metric known as Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED) for computing the similarity score between two online traces of signature data samples. We derive a set of secondary features from the online trace of a user's signature and further propose to employ a sequence of Autoregressive coefficients. The TWED algorithm is applied on the set of features obtained from the online traces of signatures. In our approach, we use Support Vector Machine for classification of the samples as either genuine or forgery. We formulate a new kernel function based on the TWED metric in the SVM framework for verification. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm, we perform a set of experiments on the publicly available MCYT-100 database. We present improvements over several state of art works.",1,"Online Signature Verification using Time Warp Edit Distance based kernel

A Deep Learning Framework with Histogram Features for Online Writer Identification,"Sounak Ray, Addrish Roy, Suresh Sundaram",2020/9/8,,,,IEEE,"This paper proposes a technique to identify the authorship of an online handwritten text using descriptors inspired by the Pattern of Local Gravitational Force (PLGF) from the area of computer vision. The strategy strives to leverage the spatial and temporal information in an online handwritten trace. A noteworthy aspect is that the spatial descriptors are based on histograms that are generated by incorporating the pressure and velocity information encapsulated in the sub-strokes of a writer. Thereafter, we utilize sequence modelling techniques to capture the temporal information present in the sequence of descriptors obtained from consecutive sub-strokes. By considering a sub-stroke as a basic temporal unit of a writer's trace, we propose a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder to compress the sequence data.

The first convolution layer accepts the sequence of (x; y) coordinates along the trace of the character as an input and outputs a convolved filtered signal.

An improved discriminative region selection methodology for online handwriting recognition,"Subhasis Mandal, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Suresh Sundaram",2019/3/7,International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR),22,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"The task of online handwriting recognition (HR) becomes often challenging due to the presence of confusing characters which are separable by a small region. To address this problem, we propose a “discriminative region (DR) selection” technique which highlights the discriminative region that distinguishes one character from another similar character. The existing DR selection approach for online handwriting often finds spurious DR when the intra-class shape variations become higher than the distinction between DRs of the two characters. The proposed technique which is an improved version of the existing approach can minimize the effect of high intra-class variations and results in robust DR selection. In addition, we propose an online HR system enabling DR-based processing in a single-stage classification framework.

Novel approaches for basic unit modeling in online handwriting recognition ﻿,Subhashish Mandal,2019,,,,,"An unconstrained, writer-independent, large vocabulary online handwritten word recognition system can be developed by modeling the basic recognition unit of the script. The basic recognition unit or the basic unit for brevity, represents the set of patterns (characters/strokes) for which the handwriting models are created. This thesis focuses on developing novel methods for basic unit modeling in online handwriting recognition. Three different directions of work are presented in this thesis for basic unit modeling. In the first part, two novel strategies are proposed to improve the classification ability of an existing basic unit recognition system by performing a reevaluation of the decision of a classifier. The classifiers namely hidden Markov model (HMM) and Dynamic time warping (DTW) are considered for the same. The second part of the thesis presents two new feature representations for the basic units, mainly from a probabilistic viewpoint. In the first representation, the probabilistic features are derived from a set of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) which are learned on the existing feature space. On the other hand, the second feature representation is extracted directly from the trace of online handwriting by adopting a convolution neural network (CNN). The third part of the thesis explores the hybrid deep neural network – hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) framework to model the basic units. Finally, all the different explorations made in the thesis are combined and the integrated system is evaluated on online handwritten word samples. The experiments are performed on databases of two scripts namely Assamese and English. We empirically show …",1,"Novel approaches for basic unit modeling in online handwriting recognition

Exploration of novel descriptors for online writer identication,Vivek Venugopal,2019,,,,,"The problem of writer identification refers to the task of deciding on the authorship of a piece of handwritten document by comparing it against a set of samples saved in a database. Technology has aided in the design of hand held devices like tablets that can capture a person's handwriting.

Exploring Discriminative HMM States for Improved Recognition of Online Handwriting,"Subhasis Mandal, Himakshi Choudhury, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Suresh Sundaram",2018/8/20,,,,IEEE,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for online handwriting recognition (HR) based on hidden Markov model (HMM). In a conventional HMM-based HR system, the input test sample is recognized by first measuring the log-likelihood score from each class-specific HMM, and then the class with the highest score is assigned as the recognized class. It is observed that, for a given test sample, the difference in log-likelihood scores of top-2 outputs (classes) is often less for faithful classification. The problem intensifies for those scripts that have a large set of similar shape characters such as the Indic script. To address this problem, first, we analyze the HMM states corresponding to the top-2 classes and identify a subset of states that most discriminate the two classes. Afterwards, the final recognition among the two classes is carried out by comparing the log-likelihood scores of these chosen states.

The recognition task is generally challenging since Assamese handwriting is mixed with the discrete and cursive writing style, and further complicated due to the placing of vowel/consonant modifier above and/or below already written character in delayed order. Also, as it contains large character set, there is lack of common definition of the basic unit (BU) for automatic recognition. As a step in this direction, first, we select 173 BU capable of characterizing 20K most frequent Assamese words. The HMMs are created for these selected BUs.

We make contributions with regards to (i) the encoding of features used and (ii) the matching strategy. Most works in the literature that consider comparing the temporal sequence between two signatures utilize the local features derived at each sample point of the online trace. One aspect worth investigating is on representing these features in a probabilistic framework. In this work, we use the parameters from a pre-learnt Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to encode the features. Secondly, with regards to matching strategy, we consider comparing a histogram between a test signature with those obtained from the enrolled signatures of a user.

An enhanced contextual DTW based system for online signature verification using Vector Quantization,"Abhishek Sharma, Suresh Sundaram",2016,Pattern Recognition Letters,84,December 2016,Elsevier,"This work presents an enhanced Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based online signature verification system by utilizing the code-vectors generated from a Vector-Quantization (VQ) strategy. The DTW algorithms in the literature use only the distance score, obtained between the test signature and the genuine enrolled signatures, for the decision rule. The optimal warping path is constructed by placing constraints between the pairs of the sample points of the signatures, that are to be aligned. Hence, at times, sole dependence of the DTW scores may not be effective to discriminate the genuine and forgery signatures of an user, especially, when their values are very close. In order to alleviate this issue, we propose a novel scheme of scoring/voting the aligned pairs in the warping path by a set of code-vectors constructed from a VQ step. We subsequently fuse this score with that of the DTW, by popular score combination …",88,"An enhanced contextual DTW based system for online signature verification using vector quantization

Combining HMM and SVM based stroke classifiers for online Assamese handwritten character recognition,"Himakshi Choudhury, Subhasis Mandal, Sanjeevan Devnath, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Suresh Sundaram",2015/12/17,,,,IEEE,Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifiers are commonly used in the field of handwriting recognition. In this paper we investigate a technique of recognizing Assamese handwritten characters using HMMs and SVM stroke classifiers in conjunction to each other. The two classifiers are separately trained on same stroke dataset with same set of features. The top-N class labels from the HMM classifier are selected and the search space of the SVM classifier is reduced by inspecting the SVM scores for the selected N classes only. The class with highest SVM score among these N classes is the predicted class. However the confidence score from the classifier is low for a predicted class if there exist some confusion with similar classes. In such cases a fall-back option to consider the decision of the HMM classifier is introduced depending on the confidence score from the SVM …,13,"Combining HMM and SVM based stroke classifiers for online Assamese handwritten character recognition

A subtractive clustering scheme for text-independent online writer identification,"Gautam Singh, Suresh Sundaram",2015/8/23,,,,IEEE,"This paper proposes a text-independent writer identification framework for online handwritten text. The method utilizes an unsupervised learning scheme termed `subtractive clustering' to discover the unique writing styles of a given author. Subtractive clustering has been adopted in the literature for the problems of image segmentation and speaker identification. To the best of our knowledge, its applicability in the domain of writer identification is yet to be explored. Unlike traditional clustering techniques such as k-means and fuzzy c-means, the subtractive clustering algorithm does not rely on the initial choice of seed points. Instead, it locates the high density regions in the feature space, and this make this scheme an interesting exploration to capture the writing styles of an author (referred to as `prototypes').

Curvature point based hmm state prediction for online handwritten Assamese strokes recognition,"Subhasis Mandal, SR Mahadeva Prasanna, Suresh Sundaram",2015/2/27,,,,IEEE,"Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are used in handwritten strokes recognition task. The two design parameters of HMM are the number of states and number of mixtures in each state. There are two approaches for finding the number of states, namely, equal number of states and variable number of states. Since the shape of strokes will be different, variable number of states approach should be beneficial. This work proposes a curvature point detection based method to predict variable number of states for modeling a handwritten stroke. The proposed method selects appropriate points from a trace so that the portion between two consecutive points is modeled as an HMM state. Accordingly, based upon handwritten stroke shape complexity, the number of appropriate points selected will change and hence the number of states assigned to the corresponding stroke.

Class-specific features derived from these regions aid in reducing the degree of confusion. Thirdly, statistics of specific features are proposed for resolving any confusions in vowel modifiers.

A page of text can be segmented at the line, word and then the symbol level. The symbols are recognized using a SVM classifier with RBF kernel trained to recognize 155 distinct Tamil symbols, which can make up all the 313 different characters in Tamil. By analyzing the cross-validation performance of the classifier, the sets of confused symbols have been identified. If the recognition label of a symbol corresponds to that of a confused symbol, then the feature vector of the corresponding stroke group is fed to an expert classifier trained only on the set of confused symbols. Then, the recognized symbols of each word are corrected using a symbol level bigram model derived from a huge text corpus. Finally, the sequence of symbol labels corresponding to each word is converted to the Tamil Unicode sequence using a set of rules. The recognition engine at the level of a handwritten word has been developed in C as a. dll and integrated with the census data collection application developed by CDAC Pune. On the annotated dataset of 45,405 words collected from over a hundred Tamil writers, the engine has a recognition performance of 83.2% at the symbol level and 54.2% at the word level, without the use of expert classifiers.

Lexicon-free recognition strategies for online handwritten Tamil words,Suresh Sundaram,2011/12/12,,,,,"In this thesis, we address some of the challenges involved in developing a robust writerindependent, lexicon-free system to recognize online Tamil words. Tamil, being a Dravidian language, is morphologically rich and also agglutinative and thus does not have a finite lexicon. For example, a single verb root can easily lead to hundreds of words after morphological changes and agglutination. Further, adoption of a lexicon-free recognition approach can be applied to form-filling applications, wherein the lexicon can become cumbersome (if not impossible) to capture all possible names. Under such circumstances, one must necessarily explore the possibility of segmenting a Tamil word to its individual symbols.
Modern day Tamil alphabet comprises 23 consonants and 11 vowels forming a total combination of 313 characters/aksharas. A minimal set of 155 distinct symbols have been derived to recognize these characters. A corpus of isolated Tamil symbols (IWFHR database) is used for deriving the various statistics proposed in this work. To address the challenges of segmentation and recognition (the primary focus of the thesis), Tamil words are collected using a custom application running on a tablet PC. A set of 10000 words (comprising 53246 symbols) have been collected from high school students and used for the experiments in this thesis. We refer to this database as the ‘MILE word database’.",4,"Lexicon-free recognition strategies for online handwritten Tamil words

The number of strokes in the preprocessed character is used for classification at the second level while a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier is employed at the final level. The method that uses the trajectory of the pen motion information is not sensitive to the length of the character and therefore outperforms the method using quantized slope information at the first level of the classifier thereby leading to an increase in the final classification accuracy at the third level from 85% to 96%.",12,"A novel hierarchical classification scheme for online Tamil character recognition
