A Hand Gesture-operated System for Rehabilitation using an End-to-End Detection Framework,"H Pallab Jyoti Dutta, MK Bhuyan, Debanga Raj Neog, Karl F MacDorman, RH Laskar",2023/3/2,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,,,IEEE,"We propose a hand gesture-operated system as an AI application to relieve discomfort and restore function in hand and arm movements caused by injuries and nerve and muscle complications. The system trains patients with hand exercises, such as performing hand gestures accurately, traversing within specified bounds, and operating a hand gesture calculator. However, the system requires accurate hand gesture detection, which is impeded by background clutter and variations in illumination and in the hand's size and angle. To address this, we developed a robust hand detection module that uses a single-stage transformer deep network. The transformer network encodes global information and uses bipartite matching to reduce the frequency of spurious detections. It drives a regression head and a classification head to localize the hand gesture in a bounding box and assign it a class label. Hand keypoints are …",0,"A Hand Gesture-operated System for Rehabilitation using an End-to-End Detection Framework

Retinal vessel segmentation using multi-scale residual convolutional neural network (MSR-Net) combined with generative adversarial networks,"Mithun Kumar Kar, Debanga Raj Neog, Malaya Kumar Nath",2023/2,"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing",42,2,Springer US,"Retinal fundus images provide valuable diagnostic and clinical information in the diagnosis of ophthalmologic diseases. Retinal blood vessel analysis provides important diagnostic information about thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer and alteration in the structural appearance of the optic nerve head. Here, an accurate retinal vessel detection method is proposed from fundus images using a generative adversarial network (GAN) utilizing multiple loss functions. The proposed GAN architecture consists of the generator as a segmentation network and the discriminator as a classification network. The generator is a multi-scale residual convolutional neural network with skip connection and up-sampling, while the discriminator is a vision transformer that acts as a binary classifier. The inception module extracts multi-scale features of vessel segments from different scales and captures fine vessel segments.

Two-Stage Hand Gesture Recognition based on Hand Keypoints Localization,"Debanga Raj Neog, MK Bhuyan, Mousumi Das, RH Lashkar",2022/3/24,,,,IEEE,"Hand gesture is an important component of non-verbal communication, and the appropriate categorization of the gestures is quintessential for fruitful communication. Hand gestures are used in many human-computer interfaces for their natural and simplistic contactless way of conveying instruction to the interface. However, the recognition of hand gestures is complicated by numerous factors. This paper addresses a few issues by proposing a two-stage recognition framework that uses a hand joint localization technique. Firstly, the proposed method predicts hand keypoints that localize the region of interest by encompassing the hand region through a bounding box. Subsequently, this region of interest is used in gesture recognizing. The proposed work uses only one input modality-RGB image and performs phenomenally despite background clutter and illumination variation.",0,"Two-Stage Hand Gesture Recognition based on Hand Keypoints Localization

This technique has become a vital part of image analysis nowadays as it facilitates the description, categorization, and visualization of the regions of interest in an image. The recent developments in computer vision algorithms and the increasing availability of large datasets have made semantic image segmentation very popular in the field of computer vision. Motivated by the human visual system which can identify objects in a complex scene very efficiently, researchers are interested in building a model that can semantically segment an image into meaningful object classes.

Transfer Learning in Deep Neural Networks,"Debanga Raj Neog, Prithu Banerjee, Ritika Jain",2020,,,,,"In the traditional machine learning approaches of obtaining models from data, there is an inherent assumption that the training data and the future data both lie in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real world applications like medicine, where training data is very scarce or difficult to obtain; model acquisition becomes a challenge. For instance, we may have a classification task in one domain of interest whereas sufficient training data is available in a different domain of interest. The latter domain may have a different feature space or follow a different distribution from the one we are interested in. In such cases, carrying forward the structural properties of a model learned in a source domain where training data is ample and reusing it partially or fully in a target domain can save us expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning approach and this survey focuses on various DNN architectures, different training methods adopted to train those and their performance in several application domains.",1,"Transfer Learning in Deep Neural Networks

Measurement and animation of the eye region of the human face in reduced coordinates,Debanga Raj Neog,2018,,,,,"The goal of this dissertation is to develop methods to measure, model, and animate facial tissues of the region around the eyes, referred to as the eye region. First, we measure the subtle movements of the soft tissues of the eye region using a monocular RGB-D camera setup, and second, we model and animate these movements using parameterized motion models. The muscles and skin of the eye region are very thin and sheetlike. By representing these tissues as thin elastic sheets in reduced coordinates, we have shown how we can measure and animate these tissues efficiently. To measure tissue movements, we optically track both eye and skin motions using monocular video sequences. The key idea here is to use a reduced coordinates framework to model thin sheet-like facial skin of the eye region. This framework implicitly constrains skin to conform to the shape of the underlying object when it slides. The skin configuration can then be efficiently reconstructed in 3D by tracking two dimensional skin features in video. This reduced coordinates model allows interactive real-time animation of the eye region in WebGL enabled devices using a small number of animation parameters, including gaze. Additionally, we have shown that the same reduced coordinates framework can also be used for physics-based simulation of the facial tissue movements and to produce tissue deformations that occur in facial expressions. We validated our skin measurement and animation algorithms using skin movement sequences with known skin motions, and we can recover skin sliding motions with low reconstruction errors.

Thin Skin Elastodynamics,"Duo Li, Shinjiro Sueda, Debanga Raj Neog, Dinesh Pai",2013/7,ACM Transaction on Graphics,32,4,ACM,"We present a novel approach for simulating thin hyperelastic skin. Real human skin is only a few millimeters thick. It can stretch and slide over underlying body structures such as muscles, bones, and tendons, revealing rich details of a moving character. Simulating such skin is challenging because it is in close contact with the body and shares its geometry. Despite major advances in simulating elastodynamics of cloth and soft bodies for computer graphics, such methods are difficult to use for simulating thin skin due to the need to deal with non-conforming meshes, collision detection, and contact response. We propose a novel Eulerian representation of skin that avoids all the difficulties of constraining the skin to lie on the body surface by working directly on the surface itself.

内視鏡画像からの鏡面反射成分除去と反射率一様化による Lambert 画像の生成,"Yuki Shimasaki, Yuji Iwahori, Debanga Raj Neog, Kunio Kasugai",,,,,,"医療の現場において内視鏡カメラを用いた診察は盛んに行われている. その中でポリープを認識することは重要である. しかし, 内視鏡を用いた診察は経験豊富な医師においても判断が困難となる状況も多く, 診察時間が長引くことで, 医師, 患者双方の負担が増えるといった問題がある. そこで, 医師の経験に左右されずにポリープを認識することを目的として撮影された内視鏡画像からのポリープの形状を復元することを目的として, 撮影された内視鏡画像からの形状復元が研究されている. 三次元の情報が得られることで, 診断時間の短縮のほか, 患者へのわかりやすい説明ができるなどのメリットも期待されている. 従来の形状復元手法として, 内視鏡環境である点光源, 透視投影下での反射率一様な完全拡散反射 (Lambert 反射) を仮定して, 画像 1 枚から形状を復元する手法が提案されている [1]. しかし, 実際に撮影された内視鏡画像のほとんどには鏡面反射成分が含まれており, Lambert 反射の仮定では条件に当てはまらない. また, 様々なテクスチャが存在しているために複数の色を持 …",0,"内視鏡画像からの鏡面反射成分除去と反射率一様化による Lambert 画像の生成
