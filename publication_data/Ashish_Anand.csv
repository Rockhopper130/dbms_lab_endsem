SpliceViNCI: Visualizing the splicing of non-canonical introns through recurrent neural networks,"Aparajita Dutta, Kusum Kumari Singh, Ashish Anand",2021/8/4,Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,19,04,World Scientific Publishing Company,"Most of the current computational models for splice junction prediction are based on the identification of canonical splice junctions. However, it is observed that the junctions lacking the consensus dimers GT and AG also undergo splicing. Identification of such splice junctions, called the non-canonical splice junctions, is also essential for a comprehensive understanding of the splicing phenomenon. This work focuses on the identification of non-canonical splice junctions through the application of a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network. Furthermore, we apply a back-propagation-based (integrated gradient) and a perturbation-based (occlusion) visualization techniques to extract the non-canonical splicing features learned by the model. The features obtained are validated with the existing knowledge from the literature. Integrated gradient extracts features that comprise contiguous nucleotides …",2,"SpliceViNCI: Visualizing the splicing of non-canonical introns through recurrent neural networks

A new family of similarity measures for scoring confidence of protein interactions using Gene Ontology,"Madhusudan Paul, Ashish Anand",2021/5/24,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,19,1,IEEE,"The large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has the potential to play a significant role in the endeavor of understanding cellular processes. However, the presence of a considerable fraction of false positives is a bottleneck in realizing this potential. There have been continuous efforts to utilize complementary resources for scoring confidence of PPIs in a manner that false positive interactions get a low confidence score. Gene Ontology (GO), a taxonomy of biological terms to represent the properties of gene products and their relations, has been widely used for this purpose. We utilize GO to introduce a new set of specificity measures: Relative Depth Specificity (RDS), Relative Node-based Specificity (RNS), and Relative Edge-based Specificity (RES), leading to a new family of similarity measures. We use these similarity measures to obtain a confidence score for each PPI. We evaluate the new measures …",6,"A new family of similarity measures for scoring confidence of protein interactions using Gene Ontology

Multi-stage Attention based Visual Question Answering,"Aakansha Mishra, Ashish Anand, Prithwijit Guha",2021/1/10,,,,IEEE,"Recent developments in the field of Visual Question Answering (VQA) have witnessed promising improvements in performance through contributions in attention based networks. Most such approaches have focused on unidirectional attention that leverage over attention from textual domain (question) on visual space. These approaches mostly focused on learning high-quality attention in the visual space. In contrast, this work proposes an alternating bi-directional attention framework. First, a question to image attention helps to learn the robust visual space embedding, and second, an image to question attention helps to improve the question embedding. This attention mechanism is realized in an alternating fashion i.e. question-to-image followed by image-to-question and is repeated for maximizing performance. We believe that this process of alternating attention generation helps both the modalities and leads to …",2,"Multi-stage Attention based Visual Question Answering

Our pipeline consists of a Knowledge Graph (KG) created from the Open Source CORD-19 dataset by fully automating the procedure of information extraction using SciBERT. The best latent entity representations are then found by benchnmarking different KG embedding techniques on the task of link prediction using a Graph Convolution Network Auto Encoder (GCN-AE). We demonstrate the utility of ERLKG with respect to COVID-19 through multiple qualitative evaluations. Due to the lack of a gold standard, we propose a relatively large intrinsic evaluation dataset for COVID-19 and use it for validating the top two performing KG embedding techniques. We find TransD to be the best performing KG embedding technique with Pearson and Spearman correlation scores of 0.4348 and 0.4570 respectively.

Impact of low-confidence interactions on computational identification of protein complexes,"Madhusudan Paul, Ashish Anand",2020/8/6,Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,18,04,World Scientific Publishing Company,"Protein complexes are the cornerstones of most of the biological processes. Identifying protein complexes is crucial in understanding the principles of cellular organization with several important applications, including in disease diagnosis. Several computational techniques have been developed to identify protein complexes from protein–protein interaction (PPI) data (equivalently, from PPI networks). These PPI data have a significant amount of false positives, which is a bottleneck in identifying protein complexes correctly. Gene ontology (GO)-based semantic similarity measures can be used to assign a confidence score to PPIs. Consequently, low-confidence PPIs are highly likely to be false positives.

CQ-VQA: Visual Question Answering on Categorized Questions,"Aakansha Mishra, Ashish Anand, Prithwijit Guha",2020/7/19,,,,IEEE,"This paper proposes CQ-VQA, a novel two-level hierarchical but end-to-end model to solve the task of visual question answering (VQA). The first level of CQ-VQA, referred to as Question Categorizer (QC), classifies questions to reduce the potential answer search space. The QC uses attended and fused features of the input question and image. The second level, referred to as Answer Predictor (AP), comprises of a set of distinct classifiers corresponding to each question category. Depending on the question category predicted by QC, only one of the classifiers of AP remains active. The loss functions of QC and AP are aggregated together to make it an end-to-end model.

Neural architectures have shown across various domains that efforts for explicit feature design can be reduced. In this work, we propose a unified framework using a bi-directional long short-term memory network (BLSTM) for named entity recognition (NER) tasks in biomedical and clinical domains. Three important characteristics of the framework are as follows: (1) The model learns contextual as well as morphological features using two different BLSTMs in a hierarchy, (2) the model uses a first-order linear conditional random field (CRF) in its output layer in cascade of BLSTM to infer label or tag sequence, and (3) the model does not use any domain-specific features or dictionary, that is, in …",9,"Unified neural architecture for drug, disease, and clinical entity recognition

Often such tasks require long and variable length DNA sequences in the input. In this work, we use a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder model to learn a latent representation of a fixed dimension for long and variable length DNA sequences in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate both quantitatively and qualitatively the learned latent representation for a supervised task of splice site classification. The quantitative evaluation is done under two different settings. Our experiments show that these representations can be used as features or priors in closely related tasks such as splice site classification. Further, in our qualitative analysis, we use a model attribution technique Integrated Gradients to infer significant sequence signatures influencing the classification accuracy.

Fine-grained entity recognition with reduced false negatives and large type coverage,"Abhishek Abhishek, Sanya Bathla Taneja, Garima Malik, Ashish Anand, Amit Awekar",2019/4/30,arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.13178,,,,"Fine-grained Entity Recognition (FgER) is the task of detecting and classifying entity mentions to a large set of types spanning diverse domains such as biomedical, finance and sports. We observe that when the type set spans several domains, detection of entity mention becomes a limitation for supervised learning models. The primary reason being lack of dataset where entity boundaries are properly annotated while covering a large spectrum of entity types. Our work directly addresses this issue. We propose Heuristics Allied with Distant Supervision (HAnDS) framework to automatically construct a quality dataset suitable for the FgER task. HAnDS framework exploits the high interlink among Wikipedia and Freebase in a pipelined manner, reducing annotation errors introduced by naively using distant supervision approach. Using HAnDS framework, we create two datasets, one suitable for building FgER systems recognizing up to 118 entity types based on the FIGER type hierarchy and another for up to 1115 entity types based on the TypeNet hierarchy. Our extensive empirical experimentation warrants the quality of the generated datasets. Along with this, we also provide a manually annotated dataset for benchmarking FgER systems.",3,"Fine-grained entity recognition with reduced false negatives and large type coverage

Collective Learning From Diverse Datasets for Entity Typing in the Wild,"Balaji Ganesan, Ashish Anand, Amit Awekar",2019,,,,,"Entity typing (ET) is the problem of assigning labels to given entity mentions in a sentence.

The CLF first creates a unified hierarchical label set (UHLS) and a label mapping by aggregating label information from all available datasets. Then it builds a single neural network classifier using UHLS, label mapping and a partial loss function. The single classifier predicts the finest possible label across all available domains even though these labels may not be present in any domain-specific dataset.

Impact of the continuous evolution of gene ontology on similarity measures,"Madhusudan Paul, Ashish Anand, Saptarshi Pyne",2019,,,,Springer International Publishing,"Gene Ontology (GO) is a taxonomy of biological terms related to the properties of genes and gene products. It can be used to define a similarity measure between two gene products and assign a confidence score to protein-protein interactions (PPIs). GO is being evolved regularly by the addition/deletion/merging of terms. However, there is no study which evaluates the robustness of a particular similarity measure over the evolution of GO. By robustness of a similarity measure, we mean it should either improve or keep its performance similar over the evolution of GO. In this paper, we systematically study the same for the task of scoring confidence of PPIs using GO-based similarity measures.

The rationale behind our approach is that CNNs can effectively identify coarse-grained local features in a sentence, while RNNs are more suited for long-term dependencies. We compare our CRNN model with several baselines on two biomedical datasets, namely the i2b2-2010 clinical relation extraction challenge dataset, and the SemEval-2013 DDI extraction dataset. We also evaluate an attentive pooling technique and report its performance in comparison with the conventional max pooling method.

Representation learning of drug and disease terms for drug repositioning,"Sahil Manchanda, Ashish Anand",2017/6/21,,,,IEEE,"Drug repositioning (DR) refers to identification of novel indications for the approved drugs. The requirement of huge investment of time as well as money and risk of failure in clinical trials have led to surge in interest in drug repositioning. DR exploits two major aspects associated with drugs and diseases: existence of similarity among drugs and among diseases due to their shared involved genes or pathways or common biological effects. Existing methods of identifying drug-disease association majorly rely on the information available in the structured databases only.

Biomedical event trigger identification using bidirectional recurrent neural network based models,"Patchigolla VSS Rahul, Sunil Kumar Sahu, Ashish Anand",2017/5/26,arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.09516,,,,Biomedical events describe complex interactions between various biomedical entities. Event trigger is a word or a phrase which typically signifies the occurrence of an event. Event trigger identification is an important first step in all event extraction methods. However many of the current approaches either rely on complex hand-crafted features or consider features only within a window. In this paper we propose a method that takes the advantage of recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract higher level features present across the sentence. Thus hidden state representation of RNN along with word and entity type embedding as features avoid relying on the complex hand-crafted features generated using various NLP toolkits. Our experiments have shown to achieve state-of-art F1-score on Multi Level Event Extraction (MLEE) corpus. We have also performed category-wise analysis of the result and discussed the importance of various features in trigger identification task.,40,"Biomedical event trigger identification using bidirectional recurrent neural network based models

Fine-grained entity type classification by jointly learning representations and label embeddings,"Ashish Anand, Amit Awekar",2017/2/22,arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.06709,,,,"Fine-grained entity type classification (FETC) is the task of classifying an entity mention to a broad set of types. Distant supervision paradigm is extensively used to generate training data for this task. However, generated training data assigns same set of labels to every mention of an entity without considering its local context. Existing FETC systems have two major drawbacks: assuming training data to be noise free and use of hand crafted features. Our work overcomes both drawbacks. We propose a neural network model that jointly learns entity mentions and their context representation to eliminate use of hand crafted features. Our model treats training data as noisy and uses non-parametric variant of hinge loss function. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets, namely FIGER (GOLD) and BBN with an average relative improvement of 2.69% in micro-F1 score.

Although there are algorithms for detecting overlapping communities, majority of these are unable to detect highly overlapping communities properly. The performance of these algorithms falls sharply when overlapping nodes belong to more than three communities.

Feature selection is one of the most important and challenging tasks, when it comes to dealing with large datasets with tens or hundreds of thousands of variables. Areas of web-mining and gene expression array analysis provide examples, where selection of interesting and useful features determines the performance of subsequent analysis.

Also, the sperm count of mutant mice tended to be reduced, but the quality of their sperm cells was normal. No significant changes were observed in the serum levels of LH and FSH or in the intratesticular testosterone concentration between the knockout animals and their wild-type littermates.
