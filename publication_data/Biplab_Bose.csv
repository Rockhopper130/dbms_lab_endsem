The Mathematics of Phenotypic State Transition: Paths and Potential,"Vimalathithan Devaraj, Biplab Bose",2020,Journal of the Indian Institute of Science,100,3,Springer India,"Change in the phenotype of a cell is considered as a transition of a cell from one cellular state to another. Cellular state transition can be driven by an external cue or by the noise in molecular processes. Over the years, generalized physical principles, and associated mathematical models have been developed to understand phenotypic state transition. Starting with Waddington’s epigenetic landscape, phenotypic state transition is seen as a movement of cells on a potential landscape. Though the landscape model is close to the thermodynamic principles of state change, it is difficult to envisage it from experimental observations. Therefore, phenotypic state transition is often considered as a discrete state jump process. This approach is particularly useful to estimate the paths of state transition from experimental observations. In this review, we discuss both of these approaches and the associated mathematical …",4,"The mathematics of phenotypic state transition: paths and potential

Peptides derived from a short stretch of diphtheria toxin bind to heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor,"Mahesh Agarwal, Tanmay Mondal, Biplab Bose",2019/11/1,Toxicon,169,,Pergamon,"Membrane-anchored heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is the receptor for diphtheria toxin (DT). Mutated or truncated, non-toxic DT has been used earlier for HB-EGF-targeted drug delivery and to modulate HB-EGF signaling. In the present work, we have synthesized a peptide corresponding to a 26 amino acid long stretch of the receptor-binding domain of DT. This region of DT makes multiple contacts with HB-EGF and has residues critical for binding to HB-EGF. We show that this peptide and two of its mutants bind to HB-EGF. We have also created recombinant proteins by fusing Maltose-binding Protein (MBP) with these peptides. These recombinant MBP-tagged peptides bind to HB-EGF with affinities in the range of 10−7 to 10−8 M. We have observed that these MBP-tagged peptides can modulate molecular signaling of HB-EGF. Therefore, this 26 amino acid long stretch of DT can be considered …",1,"Peptides derived from a short stretch of diphtheria toxin bind to heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor

Percolation in a reduced equilibrium model of planar cell polarity,"Kamleswar Chandrasekaran, Biplab Bose",2019/9/17,Physical Review E,100,3,American Physical Society,"Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a biological phenomenon where a large number of cells get polarized and coordinatedly align in a plane. PCP is an example of self-organization through local and global interactions between cells. In this work, we have used a lattice-based spin model for PCP that mimics the alignment of cells through local interactions. We have investigated the equilibrium behavior of this model. In this model, alignment of cells leads to the formation of clusters of aligned cells, and such clustering exhibits percolation transition. Even though the alignment of a cell in this model depends upon its neighbors, finite-size scaling analysis shows that this model belongs to the universality class of simple two-dimensional random percolation.",2,"Percolation in a reduced equilibrium model of planar cell polarity

Morphological state transition dynamics in EGF-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition,"Vimalathithan Devaraj, Biplab Bose",2019/6/26,Journal of clinical medicine,8,7,MDPI,"Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a multi-state process. Here, we investigated phenotypic state transition dynamics of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)-induced EMT in a breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468. We have defined phenotypic states of these cells in terms of their morphologies and have shown that these cells have three distinct morphological states—cobble, spindle, and circular. The spindle and circular states are the migratory phenotypes. Using quantitative image analysis and mathematical modeling, we have deciphered state transition trajectories in different experimental conditions. This analysis shows that the phenotypic state transition during EGF-induced EMT in these cells is reversible, and depends upon the dose of EGF and level of phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR). The dominant reversible state transition trajectory in this system was cobble to circular to spindle to cobble. We have observed that there exists an ultrasensitive on/off switch involving phospho-EGFR that decides the transition of cells in and out of the circular state. In general, our observations can be explained by the conventional quasi-potential landscape model for phenotypic state transition. As an alternative to this model, we have proposed a simpler discretized energy-level model to explain the observed state transition dynamics.",39,"Morphological state transition dynamics in EGF-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition

A Negative Feedback Regulates The Flow Of Signal Through Akt/mTORC1/S6K1 Pathway,"Poulami Dutta, Vimalathithan Devaraj, Biplab Bose",2017/6/8,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,"Several growth factors, cytokines, hormones activate PI3K/Akt pathway. Akt is a key node in this pathway and activates different downstream paths. One such path is Akt/mTORC1/S6K1 that controls protein synthesis, cell survival, and proliferation. Here we show that a negative feedback controls activation of S6K1 through this pathway. Due to this negative feedback, a sustained phospho-Akt signal generates a transient pulse of phospho-S6K1. We have created a mathematical model for this circuit. Analysis of this model shows that the negative feedback acts as a filter and preferentially allows a signal, with sharp and faster rise of phospho-Akt, to induce pronounced activation of S6K1. It blocks an input with a fast oscillation of phospho-Akt to flow through this path. We show that this negative feedback leads to differential activation of S6K1 by Insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factor 1. Such differential effect may explain the difference in the mitogenic effect of these two molecules.",1,"A Negative Feedback Regulates The Flow Of Signal Through Akt/mTORC1/S6K1 Pathway

Autoregulation and heterogeneity in expression of human Cripto-1,"Pojul Loying, Janvie Manhas, Sudip Sen, Biplab Bose",2015/2/6,PLoS One,10,2,Public Library of Science,"Cripto-1 (CR-1) is involved in various processes in embryonic development and cancer. Multiple pathways regulate CR-1 expression. Our present work demonstrates a possible positive feedback circuit where CR-1 induces its own expression. Using U-87 MG cells treated with exogenous CR-1, we show that such induction involves ALK4/SMAD2/3 pathway. Stochasticity in gene expression gives rise to heterogeneity in expression in genetically identical cells. Positive feedback increases such heterogeneity and often gives rise to two subpopulations of cells, having higher and lower expression of a gene. Using flow cytometry, we show that U-87 MG cells have a minuscule subpopulation with detectable expression of CR-1. Induction of CR-1 expression, by exogenous CR-1, increases the size of this CR-1 positive subpopulation. However, even at very high dose, most of the cells remain CR-1 negative. We show that population behavior of CR-1 induction has a signature similar to bimodal expression expected in a transcriptional circuit with positive feedback. We further show that treatment of U-87 MG cells with CR-1 leads to higher expression of drug efflux protein MDR-1 in the CR-1 positive subpopulation, indicating correlated induction of these two proteins. Positive feedback driven heterogeneity in expression of CR-1 may play crucial role in phenotypic diversification of cancer cells.",8,"Autoregulation and heterogeneity in expression of human Cripto-1

The toxicity of DT is used in several therapeutic molecules. Here, we have exploited the receptor-binding ability of DT to increase cellular uptake of curcumin, a hydrophobic molecule with low bioavailability and cellular uptake. We have expressed only the receptor-binding domain of DT (RDT) in Escherichia coli. Purified RDT binds to the receptor with an affinity equivalent to that of full-length DT. It also binds to curcumin forming a curcumin–RDT complex, and this increases the fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime of curcumin. The curcumin–RDT complex binds to the receptor and associates with human glioblastoma cells (U-87 MG) expressing the receptor.

35. Molecular Modeling and Sequence Analysis of an Antibody: Understanding somatic mutations,"Biplab Bose, SK Acharya, Navin Khanna, Subrata Sinha",2006,,,,,Clustering of somatic replacement mutations in the hypervariable complementarity determining regions (CDRs) is widely considered as a signature of antigen driven affinity maturation of an antibody. Sequence analysis of variable regions of an affinity matured anti-HBs mouse monoclonal showed that the observed pattern of replacement mutations in this antibody is not significantly biased for CDR regions. We theoretically analysed the inherent mutational propensity of the germline genes of this antibody and used molecular models to explain the observed pattern of mutations. Such analysis clearly indicates that distribution of somatic mutations in a mature antibody is a result of the inherent differential mutability of different regions of antibody genes and the antigenic selection pressure (both negative and positive).,0,"35.

Problems in using statistical analysis of replacement and silent mutations in antibody genes for determining antigen‐driven affinity selection,"Biplab Bose, Subrata Sinha",2005/10,Immunology,116,2,Blackwell Science Ltd,"The analysis of molecular signatures of antigen‐driven affinity selection of B cells is of immense use in studies on normal and abnormal B cell development. Most of the published literature compares the expected and observed frequencies of replacement (R) and silent (S) mutations in the complementarity‐determining regions (CDRs) and the framework regions (FRs) of antibody genes to identify the signature of antigenic selection. The basic assumption of this statistical method is that antigenic selection creates a bias for R mutations in the CDRs and for S mutations in the FRs. However, it has been argued that the differences in intrinsic mutability among different regions of an antibody gene can generate a statistically significant bias even in the absence of any antigenic selection.
