To achieve logarithmic regret in such problems is not difficult: a variation of standard Kullback-Leibler Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) does the job. However, the constants obtained from such an analysis are poor for the following reason: i.i.d. rewards are a special case of Markov rewards and it is difficult to design an algorithm that works well independent of whether the underlying model is truly Markovian or i.i.d. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm that identifies whether the rewards from each arm are truly Markovian or i.i.d. using a total variation distance-based test. Our algorithm then switches from using a standard KL-UCB to a specialized version of KL-UCB when it determines that the arm reward is Markovian, thus resulting in low regret for both i.i.d. and Markovian settings.', 'Adaptive KL-UCB based Bandit Algorithms for Markovian and iid Settings A Roy, S Shakkottai, R Srikant - arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.06606, 2020 Related articles All 2 versions', '2020/9/14', 'Arghyadip Roy, Sanjay Shakkottai, R Srikant', 'arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.06606', 'nan', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The spindle and circular states are the migratory phenotypes. Using quantitative image analysis and mathematical modeling, we have deciphered state transition trajectories in different experimental conditions. This analysis shows that the phenotypic state transition during EGF-induced EMT in these cells is reversible, and depends upon the dose of EGF and level of phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR). The dominant reversible state transition trajectory in this system was cobble to circular to spindle to cobble. We have observed that there exists an ultrasensitive on/off switch involving phospho-EGFR that decides the transition of cells in and out of the circular state.

However, it has been argued that the differences in intrinsic mutability among different regions of an antibody gene can generate a statistically significant bias even in the absence of any antigenic selection. We have modified the existing statistical method to include the effects of intrinsic mutability of different regions of an antibody gene.

Biology has certain questions linked with organization of multiple components and processes. Often such questions involve multilevel systems. Here in this essay we argue that systems theory provides required framework and abstractions to explore those questions. We argue that systems biology should follow the logical and mathematical approach of systems theory and transmogrification of systems biology to mere collection of higher dimensional data must be avoided.

The muscles and skin of the eye region are very thin and sheetlike. By representing these tissues as thin elastic sheets in reduced coordinates, we have shown how we can measure and animate these tissues efficiently.

Similar to standard optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this additional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent (FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank structure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server can use to approximate clients\' gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM problem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can have superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle complexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity.

CausalSim uses traces from an initial RCT under a set of protocols to learn a causal network model, effectively removing the biases present in the data. Using this model, CausalSim can then simulate any protocol over the same traces (i.e., for counterfactual predictions). Key to CausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits distributional invariances that are present due to the training data coming from an RCT.

In such cases, one would ideally like to predict the outcome for every pair while only needing outcome data for a small _subset_ of pairs.

For example, in the context of movie recommender systems -- a canonical application for matrix completion -- a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is unlikely to ever watch horror films. In general, these confounders yield \'missing not at random\' (MNAR) data, which can severely impact any inference procedure that does not correct for this bias.

The question of learning distributions over permutations arises beyond capturing “choice” as well, for example, tracking a collection of objects using noisy cameras, or aggregating ranking of web-pages using outcomes of multiple search engines.

On May 4, 2020, India started the process of releasing its population from a national lockdown during which extreme social distancing was implemented. We describe and simulate an adaptive control approach to exit this situation, while maintaining the epidemic under control. Adaptive control is a flexible countercyclical policy approach, whereby different areas release from lockdown in potentially different gradual ways, dependent on the local progression of the dis-ease. Because of these features, adaptive control requires the ability to decrease or increase social distancing in response to observed and projected dynamics of the disease outbreak. We show via simulation of a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and of a synthetic intervention (SI) model that adaptive control performs at least as well as immediate and full release from lockdown starting May 4 and as full release from lockdown after a month (ie, after May 31). The key insight is that adaptive response provides the option to increase or decrease socioeconomic activity depending on how it affects disease progression and this freedom allows it to do at least as well as most other policy alternatives. We also discuss the central challenge to any nuanced release policy, including adaptive control, specifically learning how specific policies translate into changes in contact rates and thus COVID-19\'s reproductive rate in real time.', 'Adaptive control of COVID-19 outbreaks in India: Local, gradual, and trigger-based exit paths from lockdown A Malani, S Soman, S Asher, P Novosad, C Imbert… - 2020 Cited by 20 Related articles All 7 versions', '2020/7/20', 'Anup Malani, Satej Soman, Sam Asher, Paul Novosad, Clement Imbert, Vaidehi Tandel, Anish Agarwal, Abdullah Alomar, Arnab Sarker, Devavrat Shah, Dennis Shen, Jonathan Gruber, Stuti Sachdeva, David Kaiser, Luis MA Bettencourt', 'nan', 'National Bureau of Economic Research', 0, 4, 10, 6, 0, 0),

That is, we need a new notion of performance metric. As the main contribution of this work, inspired by the literature in queuing systems and control theory, we propose stability as the notion of \'goodness\': the state dynamics under the policy should remain in a bounded region with high probability. As a proof of concept, we propose an RL policy using Sparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle and argue that it satisfies the stability property as long as the system dynamics under the optimal policy respects a Lyapunov function. The assumption of existence of a Lyapunov function is not restrictive as it is equivalent to the positive recurrence or stability property of any Markov chain, i.e., if there is any policy that can stabilize the system then it must possess a Lyapunov function. And, our policy does not utilize the knowledge of the specific Lyapunov function.

To do so, it is critical to understand the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist, the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that works best for their circumstance.

This paper proposes a system, Zorro, which aims to rectify aforementioned two problems.

If we instantiate the matrix estimation subroutine with hard singular value thresholding (HSVT), then our results indicate that as long as the number of samples scales as ρ− 4r log5 (p), then our in-and out-ofsample prediction error decays to 0 as p→∞; here, ρ represents the fraction of observed (noisy) covariates, r is the (approximate) rank of the true covariate matrix, and p denotes the ambient dimension (number of predictors). As an important byproduct of our approach, we demonstrate that HSVT with regression acts as a form of implicit ℓ0-regularization since HSVT aims to find a lowrank structure within the covariance matrix. Thus, we can view the sparsity of the regression vector as a consequence of the covariate structure rather than a model assumption as is often considered in the literature.

In a high-dimensional setting where p is large but the covariates admit a low-dimensional representation (say r≪ p), then Principal Component Regression (PCR), cf.[36], is an effective approach; here, the response variables are regressed with respect to the principal components of the covariates. The resulting number of required samples to achieve vanishing prediction error now scales faster than rσ2 (≪ pσ2). Despite the tremendous utility of PCR, its ability to handle settings with noisy, missing, and mixed (discrete and continuous) valued covariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge, cf.[24].

This monograph aims to explain the success of these methods, both in theory, for which we cover foundational nonasymptotic statistical guarantees on nearest-neighbor-based regression and classification, and in practice, for which we gather prominent methods for approximate nearest neighbor search that have been essential to scaling prediction systems reliant on nearest neighbor analysis to handle massive datasets. Furthermore, we discuss connections to learning distances for use with nearest neighbor methods, including how random decision trees and ensemble methods learn nearest neighbor structure, as well as recent developments in crowdsourcing and graphons. In terms of theory, our focus is on nonasymptotic statistical guarantees, which we state in the form of how many training data and what algorithm parameters ensure that a nearest neighbor prediction method achieves a user-specified error tolerance. We begin with the most general of such results for nearest neighbor and related kernel regression and classification in general metric spaces. In such settings in which we assume very little structure, what enables successful prediction is smoothness in the function being estimated for regression, and a low probability of landing near the decision boundary for classification. In practice, these conditions could be difficult to verify empirically for a real dataset.

In graphon estimation, one is interested in estimating edge intensities or probabilities between nodes using a single snapshot of a graph realization. In the recent literature, there has been exciting development within both of these topics. In the context of crowdsourcing, the key intellectual challenge is to understand whether a given task can be more accurately denoised by aggregating answers collected from other different tasks. In the context of graphon estimation, precise information limits and estimation algorithms remain of interest. In this paper, we utilize a statistical reduction from crowdsourcing to graphon estimation to advance the state-of-art for both of these challenges. We use concepts from graphon estimation to design an algorithm that achieves better performance than the majority voting scheme for a setup that goes beyond the rank one models considered in the literature.

Study aimed to evaluate the Computed Tomography (CT) characteristics of SNIP and to correlate these characteristics with the finding of the origins of tumors. Material and Methods: Nasal cavity and paranasal sinus CT images of 38 patients were reviewed retrospectively to detect areas within which there was hyperostosis. We correlate SNIP characteristics with the detection of the origins of tumors described in the corresponding patient\'s medical records. We also assessed the CT features of hyperostosis according to the origin of tumors. Result: Surgical evaluation of 29 lesions with hyperostosis in CT images revealed that 23 of these lesions coincided with the virtual origin of tumor. The CT-based determination of the positions of the areas of hyperostosis corresponded to the actual tumor origin in 79.3% of cases. Specifically, in cases with hyperostosis within the maxillary, frontal, posterior and sphenoid, ethmoid sinuses, areas of hyperostosis corresponded to the origin of tumor without detraction. In the evaluation of the CT characteristics of hyperostosis, two patterns of localized bone thickening were noted.

Current datacenter networks primarily inherit the principles that went into the design of Internet, where congestion control and scheduling are distributed. While distributed architecture provides robustness, it suffers in terms of performance. Unlike Internet, data center is fundamentally a \'controlled\' environment. This raises the possibility of designing a centralized architecture to achieve better performance. Recent solutions such as Fastpass and Flowtune have provided the proof of this concept. This raises the question: what is theoretically optimal performance achievable in a data center? We propose a centralized policy that guarantees a per-flow end-to-end flow delay bound of (#hops flow-size gap-to-capacity). Effectively such an end-to-end delay will be experienced by flows even if we removed congestion control and scheduling constraints as the resulting queueing networks can be viewed as the classical reversible multi-class queuing network, which has a product-form stationary distribution. In the language of Harrison et al., we establish that baseline performance for this model class is achievable. Indeed, as the key contribution of this work, we propose a method to emulate such a reversible queuing network while satisfying congestion control and scheduling constraints.

We address this theoretical gap by introducing a model for online recommendation systems, cast item recommendation under the model as a learning problem, and analyze the performance of a cosine-similarity collaborative filtering method. In our model, each of users either likes or dislikes each of items. We assume there to be types of users, and all the users of a given type share a common string of probabilities determining the chance of liking each item. At each time step, we recommend an item to each user, where a key distinction from related bandit literature is that once a user consumes an item (eg, watches a movie), then that item cannot be recommended to the same user again. The goal is to maximize the number of likable items recommended to users over time. Our main result establishes that after nearly initial learning time steps, a simple collaborative filtering algorithm achieves essentially optimal performance without knowing .

Despite its long standing importance across disciplines including social choice, operations research and revenue management, little is known about this question. In case of single MNL models (no mixture), computationally and statistically tractable learning from pair-wise comparisons is feasible. However, even learning mixture of two MNL model is infeasible in general. Given this state of affairs, we seek conditions under which it is feasible to learn the mixture model in both computationally and statistically efficient manner. To that end, we present a sufficient condition as well as an efficient algorithm for learning mixed MNL models from partial preferences/comparisons data. In particular, a mixture of MNL components over objects can be learnt using samples whose size scales polynomially in and (concretely, , with when the model parameters are sufficiently {em incoherent}).

We establish nonasymptotic performance guarantees of both weighted majority voting and nearest-neighbor classification under our model accounting for how much of the time series we observe and the model complexity. Experimental results on synthetic data show weighted majority voting achieving the same misclassification rate as nearest-neighbor classification while observing less of the time series. We then use weighted majority to forecast which news topics on Twitter become trends, where we are able to detect such\' trending topics\' in advance of Twitter 79% of the time, with a mean early advantage of 1 hour and 26 minutes, a true positive rate of 95%, and a false positive rate of 4%.\'', 'A latent source model for nonparametric time series classification GH Chen, S Nikolov, D Shah - Advances in neural information processing systems, 2013 Cited by 80 Related articles All 14 versions', '2013', 'George H Chen, Stanislav Nikolov, Devavrat Shah', 'Advances in neural information processing systems', 'nan', 2, 8, 3, 9, 4, 16),

The sequential structure of the code turns out to be crucial for efficient decoding. Moreover, counter to the wisdom of having an expander structure in good codes, we show that the spinal code, despite its sequential structure, achieves capacity.

In most settings, in addition to obtaining ranking, finding \'scores\' for each object (e.g. player\'s rating) is of interest to understanding the intensity of the preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects from pairwise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with edges present between two objects if they are compared; the scores turn out to be the stationary probability of this random walk. The algorithm is model independent. To establish the efficacy of our method, however, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model in which each object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes of pairwise comparisons between objects.

In a recent work [10], this question was introduced and studied. The authors proposed rumor centrality as an estimator for detecting the source. They establish it to be the maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the popular Susceptible Infected (SI) model with exponential spreading time for regular trees. They showed that as the size of infected graph increases, for a line (2-regular tree) graph, the probability of source detection goes to 0 while for d-regular trees with d ≥ 3 the probability of detection, say αd, remains bounded away from 0 and is less than 1/2. Their results, however stop short of providing insights for the heterogeneous setting such as irregular trees or the SI model with non-exponential spreading times. This paper overcomes this limitation and establishes the effectiveness of rumor centrality for source detection for generic random trees and the SI model with a generic spreading time distribution. The key result is an interesting connection between a multi-type continuous time branching process (an equivalent representation of a generalized Polya\'s urn, cf. [1]) and the effectiveness of rumor centrality. Through this, it is possible to quantify the detection probability precisely. As a consequence, we recover all the results of [10] as a special case and more importantly, we obtain a variety of results establishing the universality of rumor centrality in the context of tree-like graphs and the SI model with a generic spreading time distribution.', 'Finding rumor sources on random graphs D Shah, T Zaman - 2012 Cited by 4 Related articles', '2012', 'Devavrat Shah, Tauhid Zaman', 'nan', 'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Example applications of such an algorithm include Ethernet and recently emerging wireless multi-access networks. For more than four decades, various researchers have established the inefficiency of (the known versions of) such algorithms to varying degrees in various setups. However, the question that has remained unresolved is that of designing an algorithm that is essentially as simple and distributed as Aloha while being efficient. In this paper, we resolve this question successfully for a network of queues when contention is modeled through independent set constraints over the network graph. The work by Tassiulas and Ephremides (1992) suggests that an algorithm that schedules queues so that the summation of “weight” of scheduled queues is maximized subject to constraints, is efficient. However, implementing such an algorithm using Aloha like mechanism has remained a mystery. We design such an algorithm building upon a Metropolis-Hastings sampling mechanism along with selection of “weight” as an appropriate function of the queue size.

('11504', 4, 'Causal matrix completion', 'Journal', 'Metropolis-Hasting method allows for designing a reversible Markov chain P on a given graph G for a target stationary distribution π. Such a Markov chain may suffer from its slow mixing time due to reversibility. Diaconis, Holmes and Neal (1997) for the ring-like chain P, and later Chen, Lovasz and Pak (2002) for an arbitrary chain P provided an explicit construction of a non-reversible Markov chain via lifting P so that its mixing time is essentially 1/Φ (P), whereΦ (P) is the conductance of P. Hence it leads to the reduction of the mixing time up to its square root. However, the construction of Chen et. al. results in expansion of size of the underlying graph during lifting; it affects the performance of algorithms (such as samplings or distributed linear dynamics) based on Markov chains. Therefore, motivated to reduce the size of the lifted chain, we provide a new lifting for an arbitrary chain based on expander graphs, which results in reduction of size up to Ω (n)(n is the number of states of P) with essentially the same mixing time. The lifting, though allows for reduction in the mixing time, cannot be reduced beyond 1/Φ (P), given a starting Markov chain P. Therefore, if P is ill-designed to begin with, 1/Φ (P) can be large. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new notion of lifting, which we call pseudo-lifting. For an arbitrary chain P and a diameter D of its underlying graph, we provide a simple pseudo-lifting with mixing time O (D) and size O (nD)–this is the fastest possible mixing time for any Markov chain up to constant for any given underlying graph.

The vehicles are routed throughout the region to service and transport the demands such that some cost function is minimized. In the case that messages arrive with stochastic arrival times and service locations, a common cost function is the minimization of the expected time between a demand’s arrival and its service completion over an infinite time horizon. The single stage problem is a natural probabilistic formulation of the canonical vehicle routing problem, the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). In the two stage problem, each demand must be picked up from one location and delivered to another, such as in an urban courier service. In this paper, we consider a four-stage extension of the pickup and delivery problem in which each demand is relayed once between a pickup and a delivery vehicle. In this single relay problem, each message requires four services: pickup, relay drop, relay pickup, and delivery. An example of such a problem is a courier service in which packages are dropped at a central sorting facility after pickup to be routed to the appropriate delivery vehicle.', 'Fundamental performance limits for multi-stage vehicle routing problems H Waisanen, D Shah, M Dahleh - Operations Research, 2007 Cited by 6 Related articles All 7 versions', '2007/8', 'H Waisanen, Devavrat Shah, M Dahleh', 'Operations Research', 'nan', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Entropy as well as entropy preservation is well-defined only in the context of purely discrete or continuous random variables. However for a mixture of discrete and continuous random variables, which arise in many interesting situations, the notions of entropy and entropy preservation have not been well understood. In this paper, we extend the notion of entropy in a natural manner for a mixed-pair random variable, a pair of random variables with one discrete and the other continuous. Our extensions are consistent with the existing definitions of entropy in the sense that there exist natural injections from discrete or continuous random variables into mixed-pair random variables such that their entropy remains the same. This extension of entropy allows us to obtain sufficient conditions for entropy preservation in mixtures of discrete and continuous random variables under bijections. The extended definition of entropy leads to an entropy rate for continuous time Markov chains. As an application, we recover a known probabilistic result related to Poisson process.

We subsequently use this to bound the mixing time of the fastest-mixing random walk on Gd (n, r). In the course of our analysis, we obtain a tight relation between the mixing time of the fastest-mixing symmetric random walk and the fastest-mixing reversible random walk with a specified equilibrium distribution on an arbitrary graph.', 'Mixing Times for Random Walks on Geometric Random Graphs.

In real traffic dividing the variable packets into cells at the input side of the switch and then reassembling these cells into packets on the output side achieve it. The disadvantages of this cell-based approach are the following: (a) bandwidth is lost as division of a packet may generate incomplete cells, and (b) additional overhead of segmentation and reassembling cells into packets.

We found that the loop mirror not only does intensity dependent shaping, but also compresses and increases the peak power due to the combined effect of optical non-linearity and group-velocity dispersion. A combination of fibers has been proposed for scaling the repetition rates from 10 to 100 GHz.

Despite the good performance of such algorithms, there is usually a lack of theoretical guarantee on their performance. A recently proposed approach to time series imputation uses matrix estimation methods to recover missing values after transforming the time series into a matrix. This approach has exhibited superior performance and provides strong theoretical guarantees of performance for a large class of time series with random missing entries with a certain probability. In this study, we tackle the particular case of missing entries in a time series that form long blocks of consecutive values of different lengths, and we identify the effect of such scenarios, involving missing values, on the accuracy of matrix estimation algorithms for time series imputation.

The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified by testing it on synthetic datasets consisting of a mixture of autoregressive process, finite sum of harmonics, and a linear trend, as well as real world datasets.

We begin by examining the difficulty of implementing wellknown deterministic solutions like the minimum weight matching algorithm, discuss a simple randomized proposed by Tassiulas [1], develop a suite of novel randomized algorithms, and discuss their theory and perfor-mance.', 'An Efﬁcient Randomized Algorithm for Input-Queued Switch Scheduling D Shah, P Giaccone, B Prabhakar Related articles', 'nan', 'Devavrat Shah, Paolo Giaccone, Balaji Prabhakar', 'nan', 'nan', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

This success naturally begs the question whether it is possible to develop similar high-performance reinforcement learning algorithms for generic sequential decision-making problems (beyond two-player games), using only the constraints of the environment as the ``rules.\'\' To address this challenge, we start by taking steps towards developing a formal understanding of AGZ. AGZ includes two key innovations: (1) it learns a policy (represented as a neural network) using {em supervised learning} with cross-entropy loss from samples generated via Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS); (2) it uses {em self-play} to learn without training data. We argue that the self-play in AGZ corresponds to learning a Nash equilibrium for the two-player game; and the supervised learning with MCTS is attempting to learn the policy corresponding to the Nash equilibrium, by establishing a novel bound on the difference between the expected return achieved by two policies in terms of the expected KL divergence (cross-entropy) of their induced distributions. To extend AGZ to generic sequential decision-making problems, we introduce a {em robust MDP} framework, in which the agent and nature effectively play a zero-sum game: the agent aims to take actions to maximize reward while nature seeks state transitions, subject to the constraints of that environment, that minimize the agent\'s reward.

A general set of sufficient conditions for the convergence and correctness of the algorithm is quite well-known when the underlying problem parametersare fixed.

Such revenue predictions form crucial inputs to assortment planning: deciding the “optimal” offer set with respect to a given objective (eg revenue) subject to various constraints (eg limited display or shelf space). Clearly, the offer set significantly impacts the choices made by the customers and, hence, the revenues and the margins seen by the seller. Therefore, it is the key decision problem, for instance, faced by retailers and has several variants depending on the desired objective and the imposed constraints. In all these variants, the key building block towards making such decisions is the procedure that estimates the revenue for a given offer set based on the historical sales data. Estimation of the revenues of a given offer set primarily requires two components:(1) prices of the products in the offer set and (2) the chance that a given product in the offer set is purchased by an incoming customer when the offer set is on display. Given prices of products, the revenue estimation boils down to predicting the share (fraction of sales) of each product in the offer set. This is challenging because of substitution behavior, where customers substitute an unavailable product with an available one. This makes the share observed for a product a combination of the primary demand for the product and the additional demand observed due to substitution. Clearly, capturing these substitution effects effectively is crucial to producing accurate revenue estimates.

Applications and instances of CPS are present in many diverse technological areas, including among others energy, transportation, telecommunications, environmental monitoring, biomedical and biological systems. Current CPS design suffers from many issues such as scalability, robustness, and performance satisfaction. In such systems, direct information about the physical world is usually acquired through a number of local entities, which can be geographically extended (eg, nervous system, sensor networks), and are often of a heterogeneous nature (eg, temperature, audio, chemical). The operation and performance requirements are global in nature, and are often represented and expressed in terms of aggregate properties of the overall system (eg, degree of maneuverability of an airplane, survival, prediction of power outage). The management of such systems entails the integration between a physical layer, which includes the underlying physical system as well as the fixed architectural constraints, and a virtual layer which addresses the design of the information layer and the supporting decision protocols which is designed to achieve a global set of objectives.

This model effectively describes important special instances like network switches, interference in wireless networks, bandwidth sharing for congestion control and traffic scheduling in road roundabouts. Fair scheduling is required because it provides isolation to different traffic flows; isolation makes the system more robust and enables providing quality of service.

Packets arriving at input port i and destined for output port j can be modeled as an edge from i to j. Current switch scheduling algorithms view the routing of packets at each time step as a selection of a bipartite matching. We take the view that the switch scheduling problem across a sequence of time-steps is an instance of the edge coloring problem for a bipartite multigraph.

While it has been widely recognized to be one of the major disease burdens in populations, complexities in definitive diagnosis present a major challenge. Usually, trained psychologists utilize conventional methods including individualized interview assessment and manually administered PHQ-8 scoring. However, heterogeneity in symptomatic presentations, which span somatic to affective complaints, impart substantial subjectivity in its diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy is further compounded by the cross-sectional nature of sporadic assessment methods during physician-office visits, especially since depressive symptoms/severity may evolve over time. With widespread acceptance of smart wearable devices and smartphones, passive monitoring of depression traits using behavioral signals such as speech presents a unique opportunity as companion diagnostics to assist the trained clinicians in objective assessment over time. Therefore, we propose a framework for automated depression classification leveraging alterations in speech patterns in the well documented and extensively studied DAIC-WOZ depression dataset. This novel tensor-based approach requires a substantially simpler implementation architecture and extracts discriminative features for depression recognition with high f1 score and accuracy.

A signal or message is the information that needs to be processed (ie transmitted or stored etc.) over time or space. If a signal varies continuously with time/space then such a signal is called an analog (or continuous time) signal. Most of the signals (eg voice, seismic data) are analog in nature. On the other hand if information is just coming at discrete time/space instants then such a signal is called a discrete signal. If a discrete signal can have values from a finite set, then the discrete signal is called a digital signal. A system is a fundamental part of the signal processing. It is a device that processes a signal to give a desired output. If a system processes an analog signal entirely in the analog domain then the system is an analog system (or continuous-time system) and the whole process is called analog signal processing. On the other hand if a system processes a digital (or discrete) signal entirely in the digital (or discrete) domain then the system is a discrete system and the whole process is known as digital (or discrete) signal processing. If a system processes signal in a mixture of digital/discrete and analog domain then it is a hybrid system. The use of electrical signals for message transmission in the nineteenth century increased the efficiency of the signal processing. At that time most of the systems were analog.

Hence, achieving efficient architectures along with enhanced accuracy is of paramount importance. Since, accuracy and model size of CNNs are intrinsically contentious in nature, the challenge is to achieve a decent trade-off between accuracy and model size. To address this, we propose a novel Factorized Pyramidal Learning (FPL) module to aggregate rich contextual information in an efficient manner. On one hand, it uses a bank of convolutional filters with multiple dilation rates which leads to multi-scale context aggregation; crucial in achieving better accuracy. On the other hand, parameters are reduced by a careful factorization of the employed filters; crucial in achieving lightweight models. Moreover, we decompose the spatial pyramid into two stages which enables a simple and efficient feature fusion within the module to solve the notorious checkerboard effect.

Such climatic change is likely to impact significantly upon freshwater resources availability. In India, demand for water has already increased manifold over the years due to urbanization, agriculture expansion, increasing population, rapid industrialization and economic development. Numerous scientific studies also report increases in the intensity, duration, and spatial extents of floods, higher atmospheric temperatures, warmer sea, changes in precipitation patterns, and changing groundwater levels. This work briefly discusses about the present scenario regarding impact of climate change on water resources in India. Due to the insufficient resolution of climate models and their generally crude representation of sub-grid scale and convective processes, little confidence can be placed in any definite predictions of such effects, although a tendency for more heavy rainfall events seems likely, and a modest increase in frequency in floods. Thus to analyses this effect, this work considers real problems about the changing flood characteristics pattern in two river regions, and the effect of spatial and temporal pattern in rainfall.

The LVET is estimated using a signal obtained through a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor. The sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are estimated by calibrating the system with the original arterial blood pressure values of the subjects. The proposed method is evaluated using different quantitative measures on the signals collected from ten subjects under the supine position. The performance of the proposed method is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are estimated from electrocardiogram (ECG)-photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG-PPG, respectively.

In a broad range of areas hand gesture techniques can be applied specifically in sign language recognition, robotic surgery, etc. In the process of hand gesture recognition, proper detection, and tracking of the moving hand become challenging due to the varied shape and size of the hand. Here the objective is to track the movement of the hand irrespective of the shape, size, and color of the hand. And, for this, a motion template guided by optical flow (OFMT) is proposed. OFMT is a compact representation of the motion information of a gesture encoded into a single image.

SFS and endoscope image are compatible on the first sight, but there are constraints for applying SFS to endoscope image.

In this paper, we consider a form of dynamic hand gestures that are characterized by total movement of the hand (arm) in space. For these types of gestures, the shape of the hand (palm) during gesturing does not bear any significance. In our work, we propose a model-based method for tracking hand motion in space, thereby estimating the hand motion trajectory. We employ the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm for time alignment and normalization of spatio-temporal variations that exist among samples belonging to the same gesture class. During training, one template trajectory and one prototype feature vector are generated for every gesture class. Features used in our work include some static and dynamic motion trajectory features. Recognition is accomplished in two stages. In the first stage, all unlikely gesture classes are eliminated by comparing the input gesture trajectory to all the template trajectories. In the next stage, feature vector extracted from the input gesture is compared to all the class prototype feature vectors using a distance classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed trajectory estimator and classifier is suitable for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) platform.', 'Trajectory guided recognition of hand gestures having only global motions MK Bhuyan, PK Bora, D Ghosh - World Academy of science, engineering and …, 2008 Cited by 54 Related articles All 6 versions', '2008/9/24', 'MK Bhuyan, PK Bora, D Ghosh', 'World Academy of science, engineering and technology', 'nan', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The performance of the model is tested on short-term rainfall and runoff data of two Indian catchments, and published data of Wills Creek and Shoal Creek.

We analyze the Coswara dataset which is collected from three subject pools, namely, i) healthy, ii) COVID-19 subjects recorded during the delta variant dominant period, and iii) data from COVID-19 subjects recorded during the omicron surge. Our findings suggest that multiple sound categories, such as cough, breathing, and speech, indicate significant acoustic feature differences when comparing COVID-19 subjects with omicron and delta variants. The classification areas-under-the-curve are significantly above chance for differentiating subjects infected by omicron from those infected by delta.

Signals that allow listeners to identify and/or disambiguate important auditory objects (an unusual rustle of leaves in a darkening forest, your winning bingo number) will likely share many acoustic characteristics with other sounds in the environment. What is more, the most diagnostic auditory dimensions for detecting the ominously rustling leaves or categorizing a crucial syllable may be obscured, distorted, or missing. Just as often, the diagnostic acoustic dimensions may change completely across contexts. These challenges are ubiquitous in speech comprehension. People talk with different accents, different speaking rates, different vocal tracts, and often at the same time. A talker may turn away from you in the middle of a conversation, and then decide to whisper the most intriguing part of their sentence, so as not to be overheard by the person they are talking about. Or, worse yet, the talker may imitate the very different and distinct voice of the object of conversation.

Although there are different schemes introduced by the control community to address this issue, it still remains a challenge in the face of control engineers. In the present work, a newer kind of robust observer based MPC has been developed, by extending the Nash game based mixed H 2/H∞ MPC, introduced earlier by the same authors (Aadaleesan and Saha, 2008b), for state feedback case. It has been shown that the overall closed-loop stability cannot be ensured for systems with individually stable observer and controller for constrained systems. To address this issue the immediate solution was given as tube-based MPC design (Mayne et al. 2006). As an alternative approach to deal with such a problem, incorporating the closed-loop robustness to disturbance rejection/model uncertainty is addressed in the present paper, as a mixed H 2/H∞ observer based MPC. Solving a robust control problem in a game theoretic approach is already well known in the control community (Basar and Olsder, 1999) and to achieve both robust performance and robust stability in a single setting is possible with mixed H 2/H∞ control. To get a better advantage of these both in controller design is attempted for the first time in (Aadaleesan and Saha, 2008b) for state feedback case.

However, formal analyses (LOS14, ROC20) proposed in the spatial reasoning literature ignore many distinctions crucial to computer vision, as a result of which these algebras have been largely ignored in vision applications. Two distinctions of relevance to visual computation are (a) whether the occluder is a moving object or part of the static background, and (b) whether the visible part of an object is a connected blob or fragmented. In this work, we develop a formal model of occlusion states that combines these criteria with overlap distinctions modeled in spatial reasoning to come up with a comprehensive set of fourteen occlusion states, which we define as OCS14. Transitions between these occlusion states are an important source of information on visual activity (eg splits and merges). We show that the resulting formalism is representationally complete in the sense that these states constitute a partition of all possible occlusion situations based on these criteria. Finally, we show results from implementations of this approach in a test application involving static camera based scene analysis, where occlusion state analysis and multiple object tracking can be used for two tasks–(a) identifying static occluders, and (b) modeling a class of interactions represented as transitions of occlusion states.

Occlusion primitive labels depend on agent positions in the image, which are determined by combining foreground blob tracking and image motion. No prior knowledge of domain or camera calibration is necessary.

The least squares estimators (LSEs) are known to be the most efficient estimators in presence of additive noise.

In this manuscript, we propose to use the weighted least squares estimators (WLSEs) of the parameters that are unknown in presence of additive white noise.

Moreover, the WLSEs behave in the same manner as one of the most well-known robust estimators, the least absolute deviation estimators (LADEs).

Unfortunately, the uncertainty in the model control variable which includes model parameters, initial and boundary conditions, propagates through the model, resulting in the degradation of streamflow forecast. Various studies in the past have shown the potential of soil moisture assimilation in hydrological models resulting in the improved forecast. Further, the efficiency of assimilation is based on the number and the distribution of observations used. This study proposes a new approach called Forward sensitivity method (FSM), which operates in two phases. By running the model and forecast sensitivity dynamics forward in time, the first phase places the observations at or near where the square of the forecast sensitivity with respect to the control takes maximum values. Then using only this subset of observations, the second phase estimates the unknown elements of the control by solving a resulting weighted least squares problem. The power of this approach is demonstrated by assimilating ASCAT soil moisture observations into a conceptual Two Parameter Model in a medium sized watershed lying in the Krishna River Basin, India. The model run extends for four monsoon years from June 2007 to June 2011 and two assimilation scenarios were tested.

This problem is examined by using Saltzman’s spectral model of convection that admits both chaotic and nonchaotic regimes and is controlled by two parameters—Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. The problem is simplified by stripping the seven-variable constraint to a three-variable constraint. Since emphasis is placed on observation positioning to avoid cost-function flatness, forecast sensitivity to controls is needed. Four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) is silent on this issue of observation placement while Forecast Sensitivity Method (FSM) delivers sensitivities used in placement. With knowledge of the temporal forecast sensitivity matrix V, derivatives of the forecast variables to controls, the cost function can be expressed as a function of the observability Gramian VTV using first-order Taylor series expansion. The goal is to locate observations at places that force the Gramian positive definite. Further, locations are chosen such that the condition number of VTV is small and this guarantees convexity in the vicinity of the cost function minimum. Four numerical experiments are executed, and results are compared with the structure of the cost function independently determined though arduous computation over a wide range of the two nondimensional numbers.

The theme of the work is use of a low-order mixed-layer model that is faithful to the phenomenon in the context of dynamic data assimilation. Data assimilation experiments in the identical-twin mode determine the best place to make observations that minimize the forecast error through adjustment of model controls. The emphasized controls are those associated with the fluxes of heat and moisture from sea to atmosphere. Results indicate that the best observations are at that time and place when the outflowing continental air passes over the warmest sea surface temperatures. In the case studied, this warmest zone is directly over the Loop Current. Observations at times long after the modified air leaves these warmest waters lead to relatively poor control adjustments and little improvement in the forecast. If input to data assimilation is restricted to observations of a single model variable over short intervals of time (the order of several hours), results are relatively poor. Yet, a significant improvement is forthcoming if one of the observations is replaced by an observation from another model variable. This result is understood through arguments based on forecast sensitivity to model control.

One of the most important means of achieving this is to use spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets of critical aerosol properties, such as spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA), which are the most important parameters for estimating aerosol radiative effects. However, observations do not provide the above; the space-borne observations though provide wide spatial coverage, are temporal snapshots and suffer from possible sensor degradation over extended periods. On the other hand, the ground-based measurements provide more accurate and temporally continuous data but are spatially near-point observations. Realizing the need for spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets on one hand and the near non-existence of such data over the south Asian region (which is one of the regions where aerosols show large heterogeneity in most of their properties), construction of accurate gridded aerosol products by synthesizing the long-term space-borne and ground-based data has been taken up as an important objective of the South West Asian Aerosol Monsoon Interactions (SWAAMI), a joint Indo-UK field campaign, aiming at characterizing aerosol–monsoon links and their variabilities over the Indian region.

Based on earlier studies, likely candidates for these errors are: incorrect parameterization of turbulent transfer processes at the air-sea interface, uncertain vertical motion above the mixed layer, and incorrect initial conditions. We investigate these possible sources of error by performing numerical experiments with a Monte Carlo ensemble prediction model applied to a well-observed case in February 1988. In essence, we examine uncertainty in prediction due to uncertainty in the model’s elements of control. A mixed-layer model with roughly 50 elements of control is used to determine forecast uncertainty due to initial conditions alone, boundary conditions alone, parameterization alone, as well as the full complement of uncertainty in these elements of control. The uncertainty is calculated at points along a predetermined outflow trajectory that originates over shelf waters in the northeastern Gulf, passes north of the Yucatan Peninsula, and terminates in the west-central Gulf—all points along the trajectory are characterized by convective heating at the sea-air interface. Results from the numerical experiments led to the following results: 1) parameterization of physical processes exerts the greatest influence on forecast uncertainty, and 2) the water-vapor mass in the mixed-layer column is uncertain by a factor of two at the trajectory’s terminal point.

Problem solution rests on a least squares formulation that accommodates over-determined/under-determined systems, ie, systems where the number of observations is greater than/less than the number of unknown elements of the control vector.

The gamma distribution was selected to fit the observed distribution of rainfall since it is well suited for rainfall data. Due to the spatially correlated nature of rainfall, a robust method of parameter estimation of the distribution is required, therefore the generalized method of moments estimation technique was selected. Hierarchical cluster analysis is then performed using the parameters of the gamma distribution as attributes to classify the objects in the target data set, and those results are compared to a subjective classification of the rainfall patterns.

Recently, Lyon and his coworkers at the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) developed an alternate black-box based approach to the analysis of scalability of large parallel codes. This approach is based on the time-honored principles from experimental design in statistics. Using this later approach, in this paper we analyze the scalability of a large code called Advance Regional Prediction System, which is a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction system on CRAY J-90 and IBM SP-2.

Presently radar data are archived on-site using 8 mm tape. Once a tape is filled, it is sent to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for permanent archival. The main disadvantages of this technology are the unreliability of the tape drives, the expense of maintaining the on-site equipment, and the reliance upon NWS technicians to change the tapes and mail them to NCDC. A secondary goal of CRAFT is to eliminate the need for in situ archival of radar data.

Unlike homogeneous bibliographic networks, a bibliographic HIN consists of multi-typed nodes such as Author, Paper, Venue, etc. and corresponding relations.

Also, coupling equation is being used under the assumption that pressure drop in each channel is the same and the total mass flow rate is equal to sum of the individual mass flow rates. The homogeneous equilibrium model is used for the analysis. Stability Map is obtained in terms of phase change number (Npch) and Subcooling Number (Nsb) by solving a set of nonlinear, coupled algebraic equations obtained at equilibrium using Newton Raphson Method. MATLAB Code is verified by comparing it with results obtained by Matcont (Open source software) under same parametric values. Numerical simulations of the time-dependent, nonlinear ODEs are carried out for selected points in the operating parameter space to obtain the actual damped and growing oscillations in the channel inlet flow velocity which confirms the stability region across the stability map. Generalized Hopf (GH) points are observed for different inclinations, they are also points for subcritical and supercritical bifurcations.(authors)', 'Two-phase flow instability and bifurcation analysis of inclined multiple uniformly heated channels-15107 AM Mishra, S Paul, S Singh, V Panday - ICAPP 2015 Proceedings, 2015', '2015', 'AM Mishra, S Paul, S Singh, V Panday', 'ICAPP 2015 Proceedings', 'nan', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Several classes of bioactive substances have been isolated and identified from basidiocarp, mycelia and spores of G. lucidum, such as polysaccharides, triterpenoids, nucleosides, sterols, fatty acids, protein and alkaloids. One of the major pharmacological properties of G. lucidum is antitumor activity and polysaccharides (GLPS) are the main component responsible for this property. In this paper, the possible role of host tree species in determining the composition of polysaccharides (GLPS) was examined. To date, a careful comparison of polysaccharides (GLPS) from different host tree species has not been performed. Fruiting bodies were collected from nine host tree species from different regions of India and examined for their polysaccharide composition. These fruit bodies were analyzed and compared on the basis of Gas liquid chromatography (GLC). The result showed the fruit body from Dalbergia sissoo was most potential for GLPS production, as it was composed of all six tested monosaccharides, including rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, fructose, glucose and mannose.

Normally, the absence of complementarities would suggest limitations in institutional supports; on the one hand, however, institutional shortfalls are not unique to India and may be encountered in many emerging market settings. In contrast, the great internal diversity of the Indian setting, with strong variations recognised amongst institutions, along with enforcement capabilities, might suggest that these tendencies are particularly pronounced. We also found a strong link between the intrinsic rewards and performance—an unexpected result in a low-income country, where wages are generally low. We suggest that this may reflect the nature of the labour market and the limited (and possibly proportionately shrinking) pool of good jobs, making exit a difficult option for all but the best qualified.

The blockages are subdivided into two different cases using two different aspect ratios (hole-width-to-height ratio) which are determined by the number of holes with four and six holes per blockage. According to the results it is observed that at all Reynolds numbers, the h and Nu increases with increase in pitch ratio up to the value of 6.0 and then decreases with further increase in pitch ratio. This variation in h and Nu is due to flow reattachment downstream of the blockage’s opening and then redevelopment of boundary layer up to the succeeding next blockage’s opening.

The main aim of our study was to evaluate the role of fluoroscopically guided caudal epidural injection with or without steroids in patients of one or two level lumbar disc herniation. Material and methods: Two groups were made group N and group S. Each patient in group S received 2 ml (80 mg) of methyl prednisolone mixed with 10 ml of lignocaine (2%) and diluted in 18 ml of normal saline and group N received 10 ml of lignocaine (2%) with 20 ml of normal saline. A total of 3 caudal epidural injections were given to each patient at an interval of 3 weeks. All patients were prospectively assessed with examination of straight leg raising, visual analogue scale pain scores and Oswestry Disability Scale at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 month interval. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed in the baseline scores between the 2 groups. At follow up, Pain scores, ODI and SLR changed significantly from baseline in both groups, with no significant differences between the two groups except at the 1 month where decrease in VAS and ODI Score was significantly more in group S.

Especially, for neutron waveguides such multilayer super mirror coatings have become an essential need for efficient neutron guides to the experimental stations. When thermal or cold neutrons reflect from a surface of a medium at grazing incidence, the refractive index of the medium is dictated by scattering length density (SLD) of the medium. Due to large contrast of SLD for neutrons, Ni (+ ve SLD) and Ti (-ve SLD) pairs are usually preferred as multilayer coatings for neutron supermirrors. Ni/Ti multilayer having fixed bi-layer thickness acts as a narrowband mirror, which exhibits high value of neutron reflectivity at a Bragg peak for a very limited neutron wavelength regime while, supermirrors consisting of graded multilayer thickness exhibit high reflectance over a considerable zone of angles. In the present reporting, Ni/Ti based neutron mirrors and supermirrors have been deposited on crystalline silicon (111) substrate in an indigenously developed RF magnetron sputtering system.

In particular the development of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as applied to polymers, has allowed a wealth of information regarding the surface elemental and functional-group composition to be obtained. Many interesting correlations between the surface composition, as determined by XPS, and interfacial phenomena have been noted. These observations have led to the realisation that the structure and properties of the outermost 5 nm or so of a polymer can control the performance of the material in many applications. As with many characterisation techniques, there are limitations on the information obtained by XPS. This has, in part, provided the impetus for developing other techniques which would complement XPS, in terms of both compositional data and surface sensitivity. Static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS) has emerged in the last ten years as one of the most powerful techniques complementary to XPS.

Apoptosis is strictly regulated through many molecular mechanisms, including the proteolytic enzymes such as cathepsin D.

Cathepsin D also stimulates the apoptosis by DNA damaging agents and through p53 dependent non-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Cathepsin D being a lysosomal enzyme has to be released into cytosol by changing the lysosomal membrane potential or by the over expression of cathepsin d gene. Concanamycin A and Bafilomycin A1, specific inhibitor of V-type ATPase might change the lysosome membrane potential releasing cathepsin D in the cytosol and inducing apoptosis.

In OFDM systems the available spectrum are divided into many orthogonal sub-channels, which are instantaneously used to data transmission. Also, in this technique the inter-symbol interference (ISI) which is induced due to frequency selective channels can be reduced by adding the cyclic prefix (CP)[1]. In OFDM systems, channel estimation is necessary to obtain the channel state information (CSI), reducing the bit error rate and also to achieve a distortion less output data. There are various methods to channel estimation such as: with or without a need to parametric models, blind or pilot based methods, frequency and/or time domain analysis, adaptive or non adaptive techniques.

Feeders form a critical part of automated assembly lines (Singh et al., 2009). They are used to feed discrete parts to assembly stations or work cells or assembly cells on the production line from bulk supplies. They convert the randomness of parts into a flow in geometrical patterns such that the parts can become an integral contribution to the production process and get delivered at a pre-determined rate. Most of the time these parts are added to other parts to become the finished product at the end of an assembly line (Mitchell Jr., 2010). Feeders are sometimes also used as inspection devices (Boothroyd, 2005). Part feeders can be designed to reject certain kinds of defective parts, which when fed to the machine may result in its breakdown. Assembly process requires the presence of the correct parts, in the suitable amounts, at the appropriate places and at the right times, in the absence of which the entire production line may come to a halt. Ad-hoc setting of system parameters results in either starvation or saturation, where too less or too many parts are delivered to the work cells respectively. This chapter describes a method of studying the behaviour of part feeding devices via a statistical analysis of the given system, carried out to formulate its empirical model.

But notwithstanding its acknowledged importance in economic development, entrepreneurship is an intangible phenomena, one that is difficult to define and so inconsistent as to defy categorization in formalized discourse. Entrepreneurship appears in different sizes–from large corporations to small retail shops–and it assumes various forms. For entrepreneurship to flourish mere government support as well as natural resources of that particular region is not adequate enough as it is true that the technology, market, capital and the human resources are imperative for entrepreneurial development, but, it is equally essential that all the activities are coordinated by the spirit of an entrepreneurial mindset. It then appears that the culture of the region as well as the internal drive in a man is an important factor to play in the development of this process. Hence, this paper attempts to explore the motives of entrepreneurs belonging to Jharkhand, a state considered to be suffering with stifling entrepreneurial culture and growth. It investigates why entrepreneurship is failing in this region and further necessary measures to be taken for entrepreneurial development in this region.', 'Psycho-social dimensions of entrepreneurship in Jharkhand P Srivastava, P Pathak, S Singh - Jharkhand Social Development, 2009 Cited by 5 Related articles', '2009', 'Priyanka Srivastava, Pramod Pathak, S Singh', 'Jharkhand Social Development', 'nan', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Annual changes in gonadal weight can be used as a parameter for the gonadal activity. The observation shows marked relationship between gonadal weight cycle and seasonal changes. The gonadal weight and histological changes suggest that the seasonal alteration is an effective environmental factor in the regulation of pronounced gonadal development. The effect is manifested by changes in testicular and ovarian weight during annual breeding cycle. The result of annual study suggests parallel increase of body and gonadal weight seasonally.

In-situ rainwater conservation can be carried out either though tillage or landform management (Singh et al., 2000). Among the various landform management practices like raised and sunken bed, ridges and furrow etc. developed for Vertisols, broad-bed and furrow (BBF) system is very promising in controlling surface runoff, reducing the soil loss through erosion and increasing infiltration (Pathak et al. 1985; Singh et al. 1999). The BBF landform management system reduces the velocity of runoff water and thus increases opportunity time for water to infiltrate and reduces sediment losses. Further, during the period of heavy rainfall the furrows allow excess water to drain safely from the plots and thus avoid water congestion to the crop (Kampen, 1982). There is an urgent need to manage the water resources of Vertisols of Central India to control soil erosion and to improve use efficiency of the rainfall for sustaining crop production. This is possible through adoption of improved land management practices, which will decrease runoff and soil erosion and concomitantly improve crop yield in deep Vertisols. Stagnation of productivity of soybean based production systems due to erratic distribution of monsoonal rain and incidence of new insect-pests and diseases is leading to under-utilization of land, water, nutrient and climatic resources.

The prevalence of CVD is two to three times higher in individuals who have the MS than in age-matched controls [1]. They are also at five times the risk of developing T2DM. Over the years, obesity and its related disorders have reached epidemic proportions. The prevalence of obesity has increased to over 20% of the US adults and is an independent risk factor for CVD [2].

But, most of the Web sources are autonomous and updated independently. Clients like Web crawlers are not aware of when and how often the sources change. Unlike other studies, the process of Web page updates is modeled as non-homogeneous Poisson process and focus on determining localized rate of updates. Then various rate estimators are discussed, showing experimentally how precise they are. This paper explores two classes of problems. Firstly the localized rate of updates is estimated by dividing the given sequence of independent and inconsistent update points into consistent windows. From various experimental comparisons, the proposed Weibull estimator outperforms Duane plot (another proposed estimator) and other estimators proposed by Cho et la. and Norman Matloff in 91.5%(90.6%) of the whole windows for synthetic (real Web) datasets.

Use of nitrogenous fertilizers, viz urea has played key a role in enhancing the rice-wheat production, yet its use-efficiency in rice is only 3040% or even less (Prasad and Power 1995). Besides, fertilizer use has been sensitive to price relationship, on the other front, soil health and productivity is becoming more important in present paradigm. Therefore, we need fertilizers, which are not only cost effective but also maintain soil health favourably. This could be possible by two ways, firstly, using the inorganic fertilizers which can meet the crop nutrient demand for entire season through single application and secondly, supplementing inorganic fertilizer demand with proper proportions of organic sources. Keeping in view these concerns, present investigations were undertaken to study the effect of prilled urea, biogas slurry, neem oil-treated urea sources and their combinations in various proportions on productivity and economics of rice-wheat cropping system.

Farmers use pesticides to get rid of pest problems with meagre knowledge of proper time of application, quantity etc. and as a result they do not get desired control levels. Moreover, excessive use of insecticides often results in reduction of biodiversity of natural enemies, outbreaks of secondary pests and pesticides induced resurgence.

The correlation coefficients were estimated among all the 7 characters (plant height, biological yield, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, seed yield per plant, 100-seed weight, harvest index) in 7 parents and F 2 generations of mung bean. The maximum positive and significant correlation coefficient (0.790) in non-segregating generation, was observed between number of pods per plant and seed yield per plant, whereas, in the segregating (F 2) generation, maximum positive and significant correlation (0.874) was found between seed yield and harvest index in the cross MG-46, PDM84-146. Seed yield per plant had positive and significant correlation with biological yield, number of pods and harvest index of the parents, with number of pods per plant in all the F 2 populations, with plant height and biological yield of the cross PS-16× ML-5 and with harvest index of two cross combinations. It is concluded that the number of pods per plant was consistently associated with seed yield and therefore, should be considered for improving the seed yield in segregating generations of mung bean.', 'Study of correlation in segregating and non-segregating populations of mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.)

In this study mixed monolayers of octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) and a template amphiphile were prepared and deposited on silicon substrates as Langmuir-Blodgett films. The template amphiphiles were homogeneously dispersed within the thin silica matrix on the water surface and following pyrolization formed micro-porous membranes. Controlled pore-size patterning has been attempted by varying the mole fraction of siloxane to template amphiphile.

The premise is that very thin membranes with oriented channels as pores will have a high flux in addition to being highly selective. Applications include: (1) gas separation membranes for oxygen enrichment, partial oxidation, dehydrogenation, and purification of natural gas; (2) refractory catalytic membrane reactors; and (3) molecular recognition sensors. The methodology for making such membranes was to combine Langmuir - Blodgett (LB) technology with sol-gel chemistry to engineer pore channels within the range 3 to 20 K The channel structure was fabricated of amorphous SiO{sub 2} because of its good thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Our approach was to use LB techniques to uniformly place organic molecular spacers throughout a thin silica precursor matrix and apply this film to a substrate. LB films of solid solutions of commercially available silane amphiphiles and organic amphiphiles were fabricated. The siloxane groups were then hydrolyzed to form silica and the organic portions of the amphiphiles removed by thermal decomposition.

A total area of 54,000 square m had to be roughened within 120 days at most. The three trials used:(1) a pneumatic jack hammer;(2) a modified terrazzo cutting machine; and (3) an improvised trolley-mounted pneumatic chipping hammer. During the trials, disadvantages observed in the mechanical roughening systems included starting problems and defects of compressors, defects in pneumatic tools, and blunting and breaking of chisels. There were also trials of manual roughening methods, using an axe-type chiselling hammer and a well-designed chipping hammer. It was found that both mechanical and manual methods of roughening produced an excellent roughened PCC surface. The quality of roughening was so high that, with sufficient care, a very effective bond could be created between old and new concrete. Manual roughening was found to much cheaper than mechanical roughening, and employed many previously unemployed workers for the duration of the project.', 'A CASE STUDY ON ROUGHENING OF PCC SURFACE FOR A RIGID OVERLAY R Singh, AK Mathur, S Singh - Indian Highways, 1997', '1997/6', 'R Singh, AK Mathur, S Singh', 'Indian Highways', 'nan', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

It was implemented in all states and UTs with special focus on 10 low performing states (LPS). Uttarakhand is one of the LPS and JSY was implemented here in Sept. 2005. Objective: To find out the difference in utilization of Janani Suraksha Yojana in rural areas and urban slums. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted under Rural Health Training Centre and Urban Health Training Centre of the field practice area of department of Community Medicine. A total of 227 married women in reproductive age (15-49 years), who delivered in government hospital were considered for the study out of which 88 women belonged to rural areas and 139 women were from urban slums. Results: Out of the total number of married women who delivered at govt. hospital ie 227, majority (78.42%) were registered with some health personnel. Out of these, 74.15% women were registered with ASHA and maximum number (83.64%) of these women belonged to urban slums. Only 29.21% women went for three or more ANC visits and the proportion was higher (33.64%) in urban slums. Only 48.31% women consumed hundred IFA tablets and the proportion was high (79.41%) in rural women. All the women received complete TT immunization. Conclusion: The JSY utilization was found to be low in rural areas ie 38.7%. Thus, IEC activities should be strengthened and ASHA’s work should be properly monitored.', 'A report of sample survey on births and deaths in agra district D Nandan, N Goel, DN Pandey, S Singh, GD Barnwal - Indian Journal of Community Health, 1995 Related articles All 2 versions', '1995/9/30', 'Deoki Nandan, N Goel, DN Pandey, S Singh, GD Barnwal', 'Indian Journal of Community Health', 'nan', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

In the present paper, the authors have studied a highly neutron-rich nucleus 288 104 with a view to identify the possible target-projectile combinations for forming this heavy nucleus at the neutron-drip line. For this purpose, they have calculated the cold fragmentation potential and the formation yields of 288 104 for all the possible target-projectile combinations. Interestingly enough, they find that for cold fusion reactions, in addition to usual one or both closed (or nearly closed) spherical or deformed shell nuclei, 11 Li, 14 Be, 18 C and 22 O are also predicted to be the possible projectiles for forming 288 104. The other cold fusion reactions for forming 288 104 are 130 Cd+ 158 Ba, 98 Kr+ 190 Er, 78 Ni+ 210 Os, 62 Ti+ 226 Pb and 44 S+ 244 Ra.

In all these tasks, the size, shapes and internal structures of leaves play the key role. Thus, in many kinds of growth. analysis experiments, the leaf areas has been a useful index. Non-destructive estimates of leaf area can be obtained by ascertaining a correlation between leaf area and linear dimensions of the leaf, width and length.

Five replicates of milk and paneer were analysed for Ca, Mg, P and citrate content. Mineral content (mg/100 g) of milk was: Ca, 139.81; Mg, 18.62; P, 80.83; citrate, 289.46; and salt balance ratio, 0.43. Addition of 2.63 or 6.58 mg Ca and 3.47 or 8.71 mg P to raw milk before heating caused subtle changes in salt balance. The combined effect of added salts, heating and acidification brought about a dramatic change in the product characteristics, and reversible shifts in the colloidal to soluble phases of minerals during heating and acidification of milk. Calcium content (% w/w, wet basis) and salt balance ratios were 0.41, 0.50, 0.54, 0.40 and 0.40, and 0.61, 0.68, 0.74, 0.61 and 1.28 resp. for T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 paneer. All the paneer samples could be classified as low-calcium paneer as in low-calcium co-precipitates (0.5 to 0.8% Ca). Increases in ratios of salt balance in T1 and T2 were due to a significant increases in Ca and P but in T3 and T4 paneer the variation was due to significant decrease in P.', 'Status of some minerals of paneer made from cow milk with altered salt balance.

Based on some models, numerical solutions for the approach to equilibrium under linkage and selection have been obtained. It has been found that the equilibrium values of the two measures of disequilibrium do not become zero in all cases. The rate of approach to equilibrium is found to be dependent on the intensity of linkage, tight linkage prolonging the approach to equilibrium. Although coupling and repulsion heterozygotes become equally numerous in the population, it is possible that the equilibrium value of ‘d’ need not be zero in epistatic models.

Release of prolactin from the pituitary gland in the above animals was blocked within 4 hours by CG 603 (100 microgram/g body wt.) injection. Administration of HHE and perphenazine (15 microgram/g body wt.) in such animals resulted in significantly increased level of prolactin in the blood serum within one hour of treatment indicating an accelerated release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. Injection of cerebral cortical extract failed to induce such response in any of the specimens. From the findings of the present experimentation it is evident that the hypothalamus in C. batrachus, R. tigrina and N. piscator contained predominantly prolactin-release stimulatory factor (PRF) at the time of assessment. Probably in the aquatic poikilotherms where prolactin is not essential for their survival in hypophysectomized condition, hypothalamus contains PRF at least for some period in a year.', 'Regulation of prolactin secretion by hypothalamus in some cold blooded vertebrates.

As a result, a transducer gain proportional to an applied dc field has been obtained. With respect to the frequency responses, an increased output at higher odd harmonics as compared to transducers on piezoelectric crystals was found.

Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. and Coss., was investigated for the inheritance of leaf length and leaf width. Considerable heterosis and heterobeltiosis were found in certain hybrid combinations for both characters. Several crosses exceeded the performance of the best cultivar. Partial dominance for leaf length and overdominance for leaf width were observed. Highly significant additive gene effects were found for both characters bur only about one third of the total variance exhibited by leaf length and about one sixth of that by leaf width may be ascribed to this component. The correlation between the two characters was positive. It was concluded that breeding programs should put more emphasis on leaf length rather than leaf width for effective manipulations of leaf size.', 'Diallel analysis of leaf characteristics in Indian mustard SP Singh, D Singh - Canadian Journal of Genetics and Cytology, 1971 Cited by 2 Related articles All 2 versions', '1971/12/1', 'Shree Pal Singh, Dharampal Singh', 'Canadian Journal of Genetics and Cytology', 'NRC Research Press', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The mother liquor was extracted with petroleum ether and benzene. The benzene-insoluble syrup was diluted with water and repeatedly partitioned with n-butanol, thus concentrating the glycosidic constituents in the solvent layer. The dirty brown residue from the butanol extract was purified by dissolving in alcohol and precipitating the impurities preferentially with ether and petrol ether. Removal of the solvent gave a bitter, orange coloured powder. This was then treated with lead acetate in alcoholic solution and the precipitated lead salt filtered.

Instead of using language dependent speech-to-text transcribers for language identification, this paper investigates the efficacy of using language independent speech-to-text transcribers (trained on languages different from the target languages) in automatic language identification for various Indian languages (namely Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Gujarati, Manipuri, Mizo, Tamil and Telegu) deploying various text classification methods. It further compares the performances obtained over text generated by language independent transcribers with that of the classifiers built using audio features and manually transcribed text.

To solve this problem, a channel estimation method for OFDM under the framework of compressive sensing (CS) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, by exploiting the signal structure of recently proposed time-frequency training OFDM scheme, the auxiliary channel information is obtained. Secondly, we propose the auxiliary information based subspace pursuit (A-SP) algorithm to utilize a very small amount of frequency domain pilots embedded in the OFDM block for the exact channel estimation. Moreover, the obtained auxiliary channel information is adopted to reduce the complexity of the classical SP algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the CS-based OFDM outperforms the conventional dual pseudo noise padded OFDM and CS-based TDS-OFDM schemes in both static and mobile environments, especially when the channel length is close to or even larger than the guard interval length, where the conventional schemes fail to work completely.', 'Compressive Sensing for OFDM Systems Based Channel Estimation under Long Delay Channels SP Singh, R Pandey Related articles', 'nan', 'Shail Prakash Singh, Rashmi Pandey', 'nan', 'nan', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The DC-bus capacitor voltage unbalancing is created due to irregular charging and discharging of the capacitor which is originated by asymmetric connections produced by power semiconductor devices in the converter. The capacitor voltage unbalancing has become a burning issue and has invited an intensive research to address this problem in multilevel inverters. The key aspect in the behavior of multilevel rectifiers is to avoid the unbalance in DC-bus capacitor voltages. In the proposed work, a linear controller is used to control the total DC-bus voltage in a similar fashion as in twolevel PWM rectifiers. A non-linear controller is proposed to achieve the balancing of the DC-bus capacitor voltages. In fact, the mechanism which generates the DC-bus capacitor voltage unbalancing is studied and is used to develop the proposed control algorithm.

The smart cars ie the intelligent vehicles are defined respective to their distance, direction and speed analysis. If there is any accident happened in that network then the node sends this information to its neighbour node and like this the information is spread in all over the network.

In this there is a RSU which is attached to the main server.

It is demonstrated that these can be used to effectively match the performance of conventional concrete. The paper then explores the relationship between durability (chloride ingress) of various cement combination concretes and their environmental impact (measured in terms of embodied CO2 (ECO2)). This suggests that there is likely to be the need for some compromise in achieving performance and lowest ECO2. It is also noted that some of the low ECO2 concretes require longer times to attain the early strength necessary for structural applications.

The prime objective of economic dispatch is to minimize total cost of generation while honouring operational constraints of available generation resources. In this paper an intelligent water drop (IWD) algorithm has been proposed to solve ELD problem with an objective of minimizing the total cost of generation. Intelligent water drop algorithm is a swarm-based nature-inspired optimization algorithm, which has been inspired from natural rivers. A natural river often finds good paths among lots of possible paths in its ways from source to destination and finally find almost optimal path to their destination. These ideas are embedded into the proposed algorithm for solving economic load dispatch problem.

There has been a noteworthy debate regarding consideration of robust approaches as superior or at par with the Markowitz model, in terms of portfolio performance. In order to address this skepticism, we perform empirical analysis of three robust optimization models, namely the ones based on box, ellipsoidal and separable uncertainty sets. We conclude that robust approaches can be considered as a viable alternative to the Markowitz model, not only in simulated data but also in a real market setup, involving the Indian indices of S&P BSE 30 and S&P BSE 100.

The incidence data of the COVID-19 (during the period of 2nd March 2020 to 31st May 2020) outbreak in India was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve, making use of the exponential growth, the maximum likelihood estimation, sequential Bayesian method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction. The best fit (based on the data considered) was for the time-dependent approach. Accordingly, this approach was used to assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate. The period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3, saw a reduction in the rate of effective reproduction rate. During the same period the growth rate reduced from during the pre-lockdown to after lockdown 3, accompanied by the average doubling time increasing form - days to - days. Finally, the death-to-recovery ratio dropped from (pre-lockdown) to after lockdown 3. In conclusion, all the four metrics considered to assess the effectiveness of the lockdown, exhibited significant favourable changes, from the pre-lockdown period to the end of lockdown 3.

The derived descriptors take into account, the scores of each of the attributes in a feature vector, that are computed with regards of the proximity to their corresponding values in the assigned codevector of the codebook.', 'Exploration of novel descriptors for online writer identication V Venugopal - 2018 Related articles All 2 versions', '2019', 'Vivek Venugopal', 'nan', 'nan', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

In a conventional HMM-based HR system, the input test sample is recognized by first measuring the log-likelihood score from each class-specific HMM, and then the class with the highest score is assigned as the recognized class. It is observed that, for a given test sample, the difference in log-likelihood scores of top-2 outputs (classes) is often less for faithful classification. The problem intensifies for those scripts that have a large set of similar shape characters such as the Indic script. To address this problem, first, we analyze the HMM states corresponding to the top-2 classes and identify a subset of states that most discriminate the two classes. Afterwards, the final recognition among the two classes is carried out by comparing the log-likelihood scores of these chosen states.

The symbols are recognized using a SVM classifier with RBF kernel trained to recognize 155 distinct Tamil symbols, which can make up all the 313 different characters in Tamil. By analyzing the cross-validation performance of the classifier, the sets of confused symbols have been identified. If the recognition label of a symbol corresponds to that of a confused symbol, then the feature vector of the corresponding stroke group is fed to an expert classifier trained only on the set of confused symbols. Then, the recognized symbols of each word are corrected using a symbol level bigram model derived from a huge text corpus. Finally, the sequence of symbol labels corresponding to each word is converted to the Tamil Unicode sequence using a set of rules. The recognition engine at the level of a handwritten word has been developed in C as a. dll and integrated with the census data collection application developed by CDAC Pune. On the annotated dataset of 45,405 words collected from over a hundred Tamil writers, the engine has a recognition performance of 83.2% at the symbol level and 54.2% at the word level, without the use of expert classifiers.

However, there are very few works that deal with application of these techniques on online Tamil handwritten data. In this paper, we explore methods of developing symbol-level language models and a lexicon from a large Tamil text corpus and their application to improving symbol and word recognition accuracies. On a test database of around 2000 words, we find that bigram language models improve symbol (3%) and word recognition (8%) accuracies and while lexicon methods offer much greater improvements (30%) in terms of word recognition, there is a large dependency on choosing the right lexicon.

Tamil, being a Dravidian language, is morphologically rich and also agglutinative and thus does not have a finite lexicon. For example, a single verb root can easily lead to hundreds of words after morphological changes and agglutination. Further, adoption of a lexicon-free recognition approach can be applied to form-filling applications, wherein the lexicon can become cumbersome (if not impossible) to capture all possible names. Under such circumstances, one must necessarily explore the possibility of segmenting a Tamil word to its individual symbols. Modern day Tamil alphabet comprises 23 consonants and 11 vowels forming a total combination of 313 characters/aksharas. A minimal set of 155 distinct symbols have been derived to recognize these characters. A corpus of isolated Tamil symbols (IWFHR database) is used for deriving the various statistics proposed in this work. To address the challenges of segmentation and recognition (the primary focus of the thesis), Tamil words are collected using a custom application running on a tablet PC. A set of 10000 words (comprising 53246 symbols) have been collected from high school students and used for the experiments in this thesis.

As a preliminary attempt, this paper proposes a novel script-independent, lexicon-free method for segmenting online handwritten words to their constituent symbols.

The number of strokes in the preprocessed character is used for classification at the second level while a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier is employed at the final level.

However, this segmentation is not fully reliable because of varying writing styles resulting in varying levels of overlap. Taking cues from vertebrate visual perception, we utilize both feature based attention and feedback from the classifier to detect possible wrong segmentations. This attention-feedback segmentation (AFS) strategy splits or merges the stroke groups to correct the segmentation errors and forms valid symbols. This maiden attempt on segmentation is tested on 10000 handwritten words collected from hundreds of writers.
